Follow up, ulcerative colitis
History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 43-year-old male presenting with follow-up for ulcerative colitis and fatty liver disease. He has a long-standing history of ulcerative colitis, with the last colonoscopy performed on February 6, 2025, which showed normal mucosa and no polyps, although the bowel preparation was suboptimal. The patient reports no current issues with colitis and maintains regular bowel movements once or twice daily.
The patient also has a history of fatty liver disease, with a fibroscan in March showing mild to moderate fibrosis (F1-F2). He is currently on metformin, which was initially prescribed due to an A1c in the prediabetic range, although he has never been formally diagnosed with diabetes. His A1c has improved to 5.4 with medication and lifestyle changes.
The patient reports experiencing sciatica, with pain starting in the back of the leg about five to six months ago, now extending to the front of the leg with associated numbness in the toes. The symptoms have worsened over the past few days, and he suspects a disc issue.
Informed consent was obtained by everyone present to use ambient listening tool during the visit.

Assessment and Plan
43-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis presenting with follow-up for ulcerative colitis and fatty liver disease. The patient's ulcerative colitis is currently well-managed with mesalamine, and recent colonoscopy findings were normal despite suboptimal bowel preparation. The fatty liver disease shows mild to moderate fibrosis, and the patient is on metformin, which has helped improve his A1c levels.
The patient also reports sciatica symptoms, which have worsened recently, suggesting a possible disc issue.
1. Ulcerative Colitis
The patient's ulcerative colitis is currently stable with mesalamine therapy, and no active symptoms are reported. Continue current medication regimen and schedule follow-up colonoscopy in one year due to previous suboptimal bowel preparation.
2. Fatty Liver Disease
The patient has mild to moderate fibrosis as per the fibroscan results. Continue metformin for management and consider newer treatments like Wegovy, pending insurance approval.
3. Sciatica
The patient reports worsening sciatica symptoms, suggesting a possible disc issue. Recommend MRI to assess for disc herniation and consult with a primary care physician for further management. We will obtain back xrays to r/o ankylosis spondylosis.
4. Prediabetes
The patient's A1c has improved to 5.4 with metformin and lifestyle changes. Continue current management and monitor A1c levels regularly.
Plan:
High fiber diet (Beyond the Basics), patient education materials generated by EMR
NASH/ NAFLD Fibrosure (No CPL)
Hepatitis A & B vaccination- Twinrix
Recommend nondiabetic patients start Vitamin E 800-1000 IU / day.
Recall - Labs to be performed in 3 months.
Lose weight with diet/exercise as discussed. Attempt 10% body weight loss over 6 months.*

F/u... Starting taking Carafate
History of Present Illness:
Karen Adams is a 64 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit. Recent flare of abdominal pain, bloating and nausea a month ago. She had indigestion, belching and gas. Symptoms were progressive for about 3 days. She did not identify specific triggers for this flare. She resumed her Carafate she keeps at home as she has responded to this in the past. She took this TID then tapered down as symptoms started to improve within 7-8 days. She felt okay up until a week ago when symptoms recurred (belching, bloating and abdominal discomfort). She again resumed the Carafate and noticed improvement.  She takes Nexium 4 days a week and Pepcid 3 times a week, alternating the doses. When symptoms flare, she takes Nexium 40mg once daily. She has nausea but no vomiting. She notes chest heaviness and cough most times at night. She did discuss these symptoms with PCP and Pulmonology. She had PFTs, labs which were all okay. She will be seeing Cardiology next week.
She did recently start a new (generic) bladder medication which she is not currently taking. She does not have her gallbladder. She eats 2-3 meals a day. She has early satiety when symptoms flare. She does feel better once she passes the gas. She has mild constipation during these flares. History of mild postprandial diarrhea at times since her gallbladder. No history of diabetes or thyroid disease. Her last EGD 2022 was reviewed. Colonoscopy is up to date.  She had recent CT imaging to check on splenic aneurysms that appear stable-no records.

abnormal UGI
History of Present Illness:
Very pleasant 56 YO white female with constant diarrhea attributed to IBS-D. She has had colonoscopy with microscopic colitis. Microscopic colitis resolved with budesonide; but she had return of diarrhea. She has had extensive work-up. CT, labs, stool studies and colonoscopy were negative. Ultimately, we placed her on Viberzi which was life changing for her. She was able to stop lomotil and peptobismol and had been doing well. Unfortunately, the FDA issued a contraindication for Viberzi in patients with h/o CCY. She stopped Viberzi 2/2 this contraindication. She has had return of diarrhea. We tried colestipol, but this was not effective for her. She tried Imodium and Lomotil, and still had 6 BMs per day. Stools were better, but urgency still persisted.
After FDA warning was issued, we discussed the r/b/a to restarting Viberzi. She is s/p CCY and ERCP with sphincterotomy. We repeated Colonoscopy in 2017. This was significant for normal random colon biopsies. She had a small adenoma as well.
She is doing remarkably well on current dose Viberzi.  She is symptomatic if she takes a dose too late.  Never skips a dose.  No rectal bleeding.  She uses Imodium once per week.
She has anemia now.  She had a gastric sleeve and notes more reflux, burping and epigastric pain after eating.  No dysphagia.  +Nausea, but no vomiting.
She is on Xarelto for factor V Leiden and protein s deficiency. No blood clots. This is a contraindication to Lotronex.
In May 2016, she was admitted for symptomatic cholelithiasis with positive IOC. She had CCY and ERCP at THR Alliance. She feels better from an upper GI perspective.
She had bariatric surgery (gastric sleeve) in Sept 2020.Has been diagnosed with rectocele and cystocele.  She had repair in Oct 2021.
She has been struggling with weight and saw Dr. Matin - had UGI with moderate hiatus hernia.  Also noted was a Schatzki ring.  Some epigastric pain and mild dysphagia.  She is on omeprazole.  Pain after eating.

IBS
History of Present Illness:
Sharon Hall is a 76 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit.  Patient returns for follow visit. She is frustrated with her ongoing symptoms of IBS. Patient notes she was on a cruise in May and had diarrhea most of the trip. She was on fiber as directed by me in the past. She thought this made things worse so she stopped the fiber. After the cruise she was diagnosed with COVID after presenting to her primary care with nasal congestion. Patient felt with not COVID and more like bronchitis. Not withstanding she was placed on Paxlovid which she feels made her symptoms worse. After a week on Paxlovid she was changed to antibiotics. Upper respiratory symptoms improved but her GI symptoms worsened. At this time she resumed fiber which all made the diarrhea worse so she stopped once more. Patient notes she has had a long IBS and has always had problems regulating her bowel movements. At this time she has episodes of fecal incontinence with passage of small pellet-like stools. She has intermittent diarrhea. Other days she will pass just small stool stools that are Bristol stool form scale 1 and does not feel well evacuated.

Obtain H. pylori breath test, then can start omeprazole 20 mg daily. Avoid NSAIDs. Continue efforts at weight loss. We discussed a GERD diet in detail, patient should avoid trigger foods, avoid late meals, and elevate the head of the bed.
External hemorrhoid, perianal skin tag: resolving. We reviewed the pathophysiology, natural history, and manifestations of thrombosed external hemorrhoids. Typically, the clot resolved several days following the onset of discomfort, and conservative therapy is typically sufficient for the majority of these cases. Therapy would include fiber supplementation, with avoidance of medications which might contribute to her worsening constipation or diarrhea. Topical analgesics including those with hydrocortisone and lidocaine may be of benefit as well.
Elevated BP reading: noted on exam. Advised pt to check home BP twice daily for 2 weeks and follow up w PCP if consistently >130/80. Recommend low salt diet, regular physical activity, weight loss, and avoidance of caffeine/tobacco.

History of Present Illness:
Roosevelt Austin is a 80 year old male who is seen today for a follow-up visit. Upper endoscopy performed on 8/1/2025 to evaluate recurrent dysphagia revealed segmental mucosal changes characterized by congestion, friability and granularity in the lower third of the esophagus. There is an 8 cm long segment of inflammation. Biopsies were obtained. A 10 mm sessile polyp was again seen in the prepyloric area. Biopsies were taken. The distal esophageal biopsies showed Candida esophagitis. No evidence of Barrett's or malignancy. Prepyloric mass biopsies showed hyperplastic gastric polyp. No evidence of H. pylori. Patient was treated with Diflucan for Candida esophagitis as a cause for dysphagia. He is currently doing well without complaints of dysphagia. CBC performed on 9/9/2025 showed normal hemoglobin hematocrit levels. There were no platelet or white blood cell abnormalities noted.

History of Present Illness:
Julie Richter is a 52 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit.  She was last seen back in 2023.  Overall, she has been ok. In the past 2-3 months, she has been feeling better than she has in years.  She had a spinal stimulator put in, and that was a big recovery for her.  The heartburn and reflux remain - she is on a variation of omeprazole and nexium - alternating and all over-the-counter.  She still has to use laxatives (Dulcolax) every week - she uses 3-4 of them once a week.  She is on the Oxycodone and morphine for pain - she does seem to use less of those meds.

Assessment:
She is due for a colonoscopy, and will plan accordingly.  She has had long-standing acid reflux, and she has failed omeprazole, lansoprazole and esomeprazole.  We will try her on famotidine as well.  The constipation remains an issue, and the opioids can be a part of the problem.  We will try her on Movantik.  She failed Trulance and LInzess in the past.  Consider re-trial of Linzess, but can also consider Motegrity vs Ibsrela vs Relistor.  Hopefully, she can come off of the opioids.

He is here TODAY, accompanied by his wife, for ""episodes"" of ""breath smelling like yeast"" associated with odd behavior, per his wife acting like he is drunk when he hasn't had any alcohol to drink. His wife says she has even had him take a breathalyzer test which was positive (0.07%) despite no alcohol use. This has occurred about 3-4 times a month since last year. Usually triggered by physical activity. States he has seen a neurologist and felt seizures could be on the differential but not strongly enough to put him on AEDs. He was instructed not to drive. His gabapentin was changed to pregabalin 3 months ago, but no improvement. He has also seen an endocrinologist due to episodes of hypo or hyperglycemia with rapid changes in blood sugar. His metformin was stopped and he started Jardiance and Ozempic about 1 month ago. Since these changes, he has not had an episode. Last episode was 7/20/25.
Regarding GERD, he is currently on Omeprazole 40mg daily. Has frequent breakthrough pyrosis and reflux, sometimes associated with nausea and vomiting. Denies dysphagia, odynophagia.
Also has IBS with chronic loose BMs. Has improved some recently. Has intermittent diffuse abdominal cramping which resolves with BMs.

Chief Complaint:
Follow Up Ulcerative Colitis
History of Present Illness:
Kumar Sharma is a 51 year old male who is seen today for a follow-up visit. This is a follow up visit for management of multiple gastrointestinal issues. The previous visit was in March 2024. The primary concerns discussed today are the management of ulcerative colitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, constipation, and new onset joint pain. The patient reports having one bowel movement per day. They note that if they do not take Linzess, they will have two bowel movements, but taking Linzess increases the frequency further. There is no blood in the stool or regurgitation. The acid reflux symptoms are reported to be well-controlled with no active symptoms. The patient is currently on Entyvio every eight weeks for ulcerative colitis, which is reported to be effective. A new symptom of joint pain has developed, and there was a discussion about whether this could be related to the underlying inflammatory bowel disease. The patient inquired about the timing for the next surveillance colonoscopy.
Review of systems is negative for hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, diarrhea, constipation (currently managed), nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, odynophagia, fecal urgency, unexplained weight loss, fever, and chills.
Recent laboratory results show a mild anemia with a hemoglobin of 12.9, which is near normal. The last colonoscopy was performed in March 2024 and revealed some mild inflammation and decreased vascular supply, described as subtle changes, but overall the findings were not severe and showed improvement.
Past medical history is significant for ulcerative colitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, anemia, and constipation.

Assessment:
Discussed in detail with the patient regarding their colonoscopy results. Discussed in detail with the patient regarding pathology results. Discussed in detail with patient lab results. I have discussed with patient in detail the current diagnosis and differential diagnosis.
1. Ulcerative colitis, K51.90
- Assessment: quiescent
- Investigations planned: The next surveillance colonoscopy is scheduled for March 2026, which will be two years after the last procedure.
- Treatment planned: Continue Entyvio infusions every eight weeks.
2. Gastroesophageal reflux disease, K21.9
- Assessment: controlled
- Treatment planned: The current regimen of Omeprazole 40 milligrams daily has been effective. Due to the long-term risks associated with proton pump inhibitors, including potential for osteoporosis, impaired calcium, magnesium, and vitamin B12 absorption, and an increased risk of colon infections like Clostridioides difficile, a dose reduction was recommended.
- Medications prescribed or discussed, with instructions: Decrease Omeprazole from 40 milligrams to 20 milligrams daily.
3. Constipation, K59.00
- Assessment: controlled
- Medications prescribed or discussed, with instructions: Continue Linzess as needed for bowel regularity.
4. Arthralgia, M25.50
- Assessment: arthralgia, possibly related to inflammatory bowel disease
- Relevant referrals for Issue 4: A referral to a rheumatologist for further assessment will be made if the joint pain is persistent or significant. It was explained that a rheumatologist could provide an opinion, potentially suggest different biologic therapies, or add other medications if a condition like rheumatoid arthritis is diagnosed.
The patient is here for a follow-up on several chronic conditions including ulcerative colitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and constipation. The ulcerative colitis is stable on Entyvio, and the next colonoscopy is planned for March 2026. The gastroesophageal reflux disease is well controlled, and we will attempt to wean the Omeprazole dose from 40 milligrams to 20 milligrams daily after discussing the long-term risks of proton pump inhibitor therapy. Constipation is managed with Linzess. A new issue of joint pain was discussed, which may be an extra-intestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease. If this symptom persists or becomes significant, a referral to rheumatology will be arranged for further evaluation and management.

Additional Notes:
This was a follow-up visit for an established patient to manage multiple chronic, stable illnesses. The encounter involved reviewing interval history, discussing laboratory and procedural results, and adjusting the medication regimen for one of the chronic conditions (gastroesophageal reflux disease). A new problem (joint pain) was also addressed, which involved medical decision making regarding potential etiology and the need for a future referral. The complexity of medical decision making is moderate, given the management of multiple systemic problems and the consideration of a new significant symptom with potential systemic implications.

Assessment:
1. Gastroparesis: Patient states the most effective medication for her gastroparesis is Reglan. Reglan is the only FDA approved medication for gastroparesis. We discussed the side effects of Reglan to include tar dive dyskinesia. Patient understands the risks and would like a prescription. I suspect her bloating is and burping is also related to her gastroparesis.
2. Abdominal hernia: Patient had surgery for incarcerated hernia in December 2024. Patient feels like she is getting a hernia at her previous incision site.I will order an abdominal MRI to further evaluate. I could not appreciate a significant hernia on exam today. I will refer her to her surgeon Dr. Kari Smith for further evaluation and treatment.

Ruby Monnot is a 82 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit.
This is a patient we see GERD. Has history of diverticulitis. She is s/p CCY. Also have rheumatoid arthritis. Her last visit was June 2024 with Nancy Lee, NP.
At time of June 2024 visit, she was seen for a hospital follow up at NCB for chest pain. Was seen by cardiology with normal echo and stress test and recommended GI evaluation. Patient had what appeared to be an anaphylactic reaction to GI cocktail that was given in ER. Underwent EGD 5/14/2024 by Dr. Guil with findings of esophageal ring dilated with a 60 French balloon, small hiatal hernia 2 cm. Esophageal bx showed squamous epithelium with reflux changes. Gastritis with bx neg for H pylori.
At time of June 2024 visit patient complained of ongoing bloating and belching. Noted she had discontinued Omeprazole 40mg because she felt ""weird"" with brain fog. She was instead taking Pantoprazole 40mg twice daily without benefit. She noted previously doing well on Baclofen 5mg TID for her belching. Noted she was scheduled for colonoscopy in July for positive fecal occult study done by PCP in April 2024, but she is having episodes of tachycardia and had to cancel the study. She does follow with Dr. Bates for recurrent pericarditis with pericardial effusion, felt to be secondary to her RA.
She called earlier this month reporting a burning sensation in her throat and wanted to speak to clinical staff. When staff called her back she was reporting more issues with abdominal cramping the stools varying from loose to normal. We ordered an abdominal x-ray and advised her to start a fiber supplement. We received a copy of a Barium swallow 8/28/2025: mild tertiary contractions of the distal esophagus likely representing presbyesophagus, mild narrowing of the distal esophagus with 13mm barium pill retained in distal esophagus consistent with mild stenosis, mild silent laryngeal penetration with residual thick barium, recommend further evaluation by speech pathology.
Abdominal xray 9/5/2025: Non-obstructive bowel gas pattern; enteric contrast seen within colonic diverticula noted from recent barium contrast exam
Currently, patient reports is having a lot of gas and belching.  Says she belches probably 75 times 24 hours, says this has been going on for several years now.   States her daughter told her to come off Protonix because ""its bad for her"" and was off it for 5 days and then her food got stuck.  Says the belching did not change when she got off Protonix.  Does drink with straws frequently. Drinks a lot of carbonated beverages and drinks a coke a day.
She has since gone back on her PPI.  Says has not had any isues with swallowing again.  Says food goes down okay. Pills go down okay.  Liquids go down okay. Says no coughing when she drinks liquids.  Says has never had pneumonia. I reviewed her barium swallow results with her and discussed the abnormal findings.  She does not want an EGD and does not want a modified barium swallow with speech pathology at this time. I discussed the risks of aspiration and could cause pneumonia but she says she's never had any issues before and wants to hold off on further assessment at this time.
Reports BMs alternate between constipation and diarrhea.  She did start back on probiotics and that helps.  Takes Miralax as needed.   Says she is taking Metamucil 2 pills daily after we spoke to her about her abdominal xray and she says it is helping her.

GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease)
Abnormal barium swallow
Alternating constipation and diarrhea
Assessment:
82-year-old female here in follow-up for GERD with belching, and alternating bowel habits. And to discuss abnormal barium swallow that her primary doctor ordered.
GERD is managed with pantoprazole 40 mg once daily which does work well for her heartburn and reflux symptoms. But does not really change her belching symptoms. This has been a chronic issue for her. Discussed she should avoid using straws and should not drink carbonated beverages, both of which she does frequently.
Abnormal barium swallow–completed 8/28/2025 and ordered by her PCP but showed mild tertiary contractions of the distal esophagus likely representing presbyesophagus, mild narrowing of the distal esophagus with 13 mm barium pill retained in the distal esophagus consistent with mild stenosis, mild silent laryngeal penetration with residual thick barium recommend further evaluation by speech pathology. I reviewed all these results with her and recommended the EGD and modified barium swallow with speech pathologist but the patient declined. Discussed the risks of aspiration pneumonia. Did emphasize the importance for her to monitor her symptoms, chew her food well, take small bites etc. To continue PPI therapy. She voiced understanding and agreeance.
Alternating constipation and diarrhea–did have abdominal x-ray 9/5/2025 with mild constipation. Did have her start on Metamucil she is taking 2 pills daily and this is helping her bowel habits. She will continue this.
Plan:	famotidine 40 mg Take 1 tablet by mouth once a day
Follow-up office visit in 4 months
Renew pantoprazole 40 mg Take 1 tablet by mouth once a day 30 min before breakfast
Additional Notes:	--Continue back on your Pantoprazole (Protonix) 40mg once daily in the mornings
--Start on Famotidine (Pepcid) 40mg once in the evenings to help further protect your esophagus and see if it helps with your belching
--Please monitor your swallowing, if you start to have issues with food not passing down your throat properly or feels like it gets stuck or coughing with food then please let us know and would recommend the EGD (upper endoscopy) and also the speech pathologist swallowing evaluation'.   Take your time with chewing your food and taking smaller bites and small sips of fluid in between bites to help the food go down.
--Limit use of staws and consumption of carbonated beverages as this can worsen belching
--Continue on Metamucil, 2 pills daily"
336,09-11-2025,7004821,99204,R19.4,R19.7,Z80.0,Z86.0101,"History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 69-year-old female who presents for her first office visit in over three years. She does have a personal and family history significant for colon polyps. Normally, she had a bowel movement once a day that was soft and formed in nature. About three months ago she began to experience 3-4 episodes of diarrhea a day and nocturnal urgency. Over the past three weeks, she noted a reduction in frequency to 2-3 times per day, alternating between loose and soft and formed. She denies abdominal pain and melena. No significant weight changes.
Additionally, she noted bloating has been ongoing for the past year. She denies nausea, vomiting, or reflux symptoms. She has not identified any aggravating or alleviating factors. She does not report any significant weight changes. She uses ibuprofen on rare occasions for headaches and drinks wine once a week. No reports of tobacco use.
Her last colonoscopy in 2022 found rectal polyps (TA). She also reports a family history of colon cancer (father). She is due for a repeat colonoscopy in 2027.

Assessment:
Sisnarine Maharaj is a pleasant 76-year-old male with a past medical history of GERD, HLD, HTN, diabetes, aortic atherosclerosis, and asthma who presents to clinic for f/u onLUQ pain. We discussed the results of his recent EGD which was normal with benign biopsies. Patient has noted resolution of his abdominal pain and pyrosis since starting pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily, but does continue to experience regurgitation, which I suspect is related to dietary habits. I advised patient that the regurgitation is unlikely to resolve completely on medical therapy alone, and requires strict antireflux measures. Therefore, I again counseled him extensively on antireflux diet and lifestyle. Considering his pyrosis and abdominal pain have subsided and his EGD was benign, I also recommend he trial decreasing back to pantoprazole 40 mg daily and provided him with famotidine to use out as needed for breakthrough symptoms. Patient expressed understanding and agreed with plan
Plan:	Stop pantoprazole 40 mg BID  Dosage change
pantoprazole 40 mg Take 1 tablet by mouth once a day 30 min before breakfast
famotidine 20 mg Take 1 tablet by mouth twice a day as needed
Adhere to lifestyle and dietary modifications for GERD diet as we discussed. This includes avoiding fatty and greasy foods, fried foods, tomato based foods, caffeine, carbonated drinks, coffee and alcohol. Elevate the head of your bed 6 inches. Additionally, do not eat or drink anything including water within two hours of going to bed at night or 10pm, whichever comes first. Recommend low fat, low cholesterol diet and exercise.

She also complains of constipation and feels that her constipation symptoms seem to trigger these pain episodes. She has no bleeding or unintentional weight loss. She has upper endoscopy last year and a colonoscopy 2 years ago revealing tubular adenomas. She has a remote history of malignant melanoma in her lower abdominal area and has undergone surgery. She has not had any recent imaging.

Assessment:
I discussed the differential diagnosis of her abdominal pain. It appears to have been longstanding based on review of prior records. Endoscopic evaluation has been unremarkable. Given her persistent symptoms as well as history of malignant melanoma I would suggest CT scan of the abdomen to rule out Significant pathology. I will call her with results as soon as they are available.
She suffers from chronic constipation I will give her a trial of Linzess as that she has tried over-the-counter remedies without any improvement in her symptoms. Will see her back in a few weeks to reassess her symptoms and consider further treatment if necessary
She has a personal history of colon polyps at which time she had 3 Tubular adenomas. Recommend colonoscopy in 2026 unless clinical symptoms should suggest need for sooner evaluation

Allan Whatley is seen for follow-up regarding elevated liver enzymes and hepatic cysts.
He reports that blood work last month revealed elevated liver enzymes. An ultrasound was subsequently performed, which demonstrated fatty liver and cysts. He has a history of hepatic cysts noted on imaging as far back as 2017, typically found during evaluations for recurrent kidney stones. He believes his liver enzymes have become more elevated since his cholecystectomy in August 2022. For the past 45 days, he has initiated dietary changes, including eliminating fatty foods and red meat, which has resulted in an 8-pound weight loss. He reports occasional, limited alcohol consumption and denies any illicit drug use. He takes atorvastatin, which was started in December of the previous year. Past surgical history is significant for cholecystectomy and hernia repair. There is a family history of fatty liver disease in his mother. He does not have a history of diabetes.
- Ultrasound of the abdomen on 08/05/2024 showed diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver, a cyst in the left lobe of the liver measuring 3.2 x 3.7 x 3.4 cm, and additional smaller cysts measuring 9 x 7 x 8 mm, all felt to be benign.
- CT scan in October 2022 showed stable appearing areas of decreased attenuation, consistent with cysts. Other CTs in 2017 and 2018 also reportedly showed the cysts.
- Labs on 08/05/2025: WBC 6, Hemoglobin 16, Platelets 225, Sodium 136, Potassium 4.2, Creatinine 1.0, Alkaline Phosphatase 78, ALT 86, AST 50, Total Bilirubin 1.7, Direct Bilirubin 0.3.
- Hepatitis panel in July 2024 was negative.

Diagnoses:	Liver enzymes abnormal
Fatty liver, non-alcoholic
Hepatic cyst
Assessment:
1. Elevated Liver Enzymes and Fatty Liver Disease:
- The elevated transaminases are likely secondary to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), though other causes such as autoimmune or metabolic conditions need to be ruled out. The contribution of atorvastatin is also considered. The primary concern is to assess for the presence of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, which can lead to cirrhosis over time.
- Plan to check blood work to evaluate for autoimmune and metabolic causes of liver disease.
- A FibroScan will be scheduled to assess for liver stiffness and quantify fibrosis. This was explained to Mr. Whatley.
- He is encouraged to continue his current diet and exercise regimen, which is the most effective management for fatty liver disease.
2. Hepatic Cysts:
- These are long-standing and have been stable on prior imaging. They are considered benign simple cysts.
- No immediate intervention is required. We will continue to monitor with any future abdominal imaging.
Follow-up:
Follow up in approximately 3 months to review the results of the blood work and FibroScan.

Lucy is a very pleasant 68-year-old female with a BMI of 28 that presents to the office today to see me accompanied by her daughter in consultation from Dr. Kapoor with epigastric abdominal pain. Able to review that symptoms have somewhat improved, in mid June 2025 she was seen and evaluated in the emergency department secondary to epigastric abdominal pain. The pain at that time was occurring postprandially regardless of dietary discretion. It was with all things that she ate and drank, she had lost weight secondary to not wanting to eat. She was given a prescription for Nexium which added to the pantoprazole was able to provide the relief that the patient required and she now has only random symptoms that are mild at best. She does have occasional nausea and vomiting but she describes no solid or liquid dysphagia. She is on hemodialysis and this pain has interfered with her scheduled treatments.

Dyspepsia
Assessment:
68-year-old female with a BMI of 28 with several months of epigastric abdominal pain and dyspepsia, dyspepsia has resolved. Intermittent epigastric discomfort still occurs with mild nausea without emesis. She does have a history of diabetes which has produced renal failure requiring hemodialysis, unclear if this represents gastroparesis however without vomiting this is certainly more concerning for mucosal-based irritant/etiology such as ulcer disease or mild outlet obstruction. I do recommend she avoid nonsteroidal medicines, continue current therapy with both pantoprazole and Nexium, I recommend proceeding with endoscopy and biopsy. I have discussed the importance of a low residue diet at this time, if nothing is identified and symptoms continue. A gastric emptying scan may be of benefit.
Plan:	Lose weight with diet/exercise as discussed. Attempt 10% body weight loss over 6 months.*
Low Residue Diet, patient education materials generated by EMR
Continue current medications
Avoid NSAIDs (Motrin, Advil, ibuprofen, Aleve, Naproxen, etc.)

History of Present Illness:
Thank you so much for referring your patient for an initial gastroenterology consultation. History was obtained from the patient and mother. The patient reported experiencing constipation issues for the past month, with symptoms progressively worsening over the last few weeks. The patient experienced a loss of appetite and spent more than 20 to 30 minutes in the restroom at a time. The constipation has been a recurring issue, with periods of improvement followed by relapses. The patient had bowel movements every couple of days, often accompanied by pain and described as small, hard pebbles. The patient also experienced involuntary bowel movements resulting in soiled underwear. Abdominal pain was noted but was not significant. The patient's fluid intake consisted of one bottle of water per day, one soda, and occasional tea. The patient had a limited intake of fruits and vegetables, preferring apples, oranges, green beans, and corn. Pertinent negatives included no significant abdominal distention and no allergies to fruits or vegetables.

Diagnoses:	Constipation, slow transit
Encopresis
Abdominal pain, periumbilic (c,e)
Assessment:
1. Constipation: The patient's symptoms of infrequent bowel movements, hard stools, and soiling of underwear suggest constipation likely due to inadequate fiber and fluid intake. The long-standing nature of symptoms raises the possibility of a chronic underlying issue.
2. Possible thyroid dysfunction: The family history of possible thyroid issues raises the suspicion of a thyroid-related cause of constipation. Thyroid dysfunction can slow gastrointestinal motility, contributing to constipation.
3. Possible celiac disease: Given the family history of gastrointestinal conditions, celiac disease could be a contributory factor. Celiac disease can present with constipation due to malabsorption issues.
PLAN:
Treatment:
- Initiated a bowel regimen with increased fluid intake and dietary fiber.
- Recommended discontinuation of soda.
Tests:
- Ordered blood work to evaluate thyroid function and screen for celiac disease.
- Scheduled an abdominal X-ray to assess fecal impaction and gas distribution.
Patient Education:
- Educated on the importance of daily water and fiber intake.
- Discussed the Bristol stool chart for monitoring bowel movement consistency.
Follow-Up:
- Planned follow-up after receiving test results to reassess and adjust the treatment plan accordingly.
CARE > 60 MINUTES or mdm-high: Visit inclusive of preparing to see the patient, obtaining and/or reviewing history from parent, performing medically necessary and appropriate exam and /or evaluation, counseling and educating the patient / family / caregiver, ordering medications / tests / procedures AND/OR reviewing indications to NOT pursue additional testing, referring and communicating with other health care professionals, documenting clinical information in the EHR, independently interpreting results, overall care coordination and medical decision making, and formulating a comprehensive treatment path for the patient. treatment path for the patient.

History of Present Illness:
Travis Sibley is a 32 year old male patient who is seen today for an initial visit. Patient is here for the evaluation of new onset of constipation.
Patient presents for the evaluation of constipation that began approximately three weeks ago. Symptoms started after eating three-day -old BBQ meat, which led to food-poisoning like illness with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. He developed constipation and took OTC Dulcolax suppository with moderate relief. Two days later, while in Houston, he ate a burger and symptoms recurred.
He subsequently went to urgent care, where labs were normal and CTAP with contrast showed stool impaction. He was advised to use enemas, stool softeners, and laxatives and was prescribed pantoprazole and ondansetron. He took magnesium citrate, daily enemas, and stool softeners for several days along with pantoprazole and antiemetic, which led to improvement.
Currently, patient reports he has returned to baseline. For the past week, he has had regular bowel movements without difficulty. He denies ongoing nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or constipation. He is only takin gpantoprazole now. He denies overt GI bleeding, weight loss, or other GI alarm symptoms. No prior history of constipation. Family hx negative for GI malignancy or disorders.

History of Present Illness:
Anna Perez is a 90 year old female patient who is seen today for an initial visit. Ms. Anna Perez presents for evaluation of long-standing constipation that has worsened since her strokes in April. The patient reports difficulty with bowel movements despite the use of stool softeners, which are inconsistent in their effectiveness.
Ms. Perez has tried various treatments for her constipation, including senna, milk of magnesia, Dulcolax, and MiraLax. However, the combination of senna and milk of magnesia proved too strong, resulting in hemorrhoids. Recently, the patient started taking Benefiber and has just begun using MiraLax, though she is uncertain about the proper dosage. The patient denies seeing blood in her stool.
The constipation has been ongoing for many years, with a noticeable increase in severity following her strokes in April. The patient's daughter, who appears to be her caregiver, noticed the issue while the patient was in hospice care. The constipation impacts the patient's daily functioning, as she struggles to have bowel movements even with the use of various medications.
The patient has not had a colonoscopy or CT scan in the past. She also reports having anemia, which may be contributing to her constipation. The patient denies any current use of iron supplements.

#Chronic idiopathic constipation
Anna Perez, a 90-year-old female with a history of two strokes in April, presents with long-standing constipation that has worsened recently, causing difficulty with bowel movements despite the use of various laxatives. Previous treatments have included senna, milk of magnesia, Dulcolax, and MiraLax, with varying degrees of effectiveness. The combination of osmotic and stimulant laxatives led to explosive diarrhea and hemorrhoids. Recent initiation of Benefiber has not provided sufficient relief. No blood in stool reported. Given the patient's advanced age and history of strokes, careful consideration of treatment options is necessary.
- Start polyethylene glycol 3350 (MiraLax) 1 capful PO daily, adjusting dose as needed
- Continue Benefiber as currently taking
- Use senna as a backup laxative if no bowel movement for 3-4 days
- Order abdominal X-ray to assess extent of constipation and rule out obstruction
- Recommend over-the-counter hemorrhoid cream with multiple ingredients for symptomatic relief as needed
- Consider prescription of low dose Linzess (linaclotide) if current regimen is ineffective
- Follow up after X-ray results or sooner if symptoms worsen
Risks, Benefits, and Alternatives to the procedure were discussed with the patient including but not limited to bleeding, infection, perforation, missed lesions, incomplete exams, injury to internal organs, nausea, shortness of breath, pneumonia, cardiopulmonary events, and other anesthesia-related side effects. The patient verbalized understanding of the procedures and its risks, and agrees to undergo testing. All questions were answered. Handout Given.

History of Present Illness:
Ernest Flores is a 67-year-old male seen today for follow-up. Patient was previously seen for EGD in December 2022. This was notable for hiatal hernia and nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus. He will be due for repeat endoscopy at the end of this year for surveillance. Patient states that over the last 4 weeks or so, he has been having more issues with abdominal pain, bloating/gas, acid reflux and a persistent cough. Patient has also had a couple episodes where he wakes up in the middle of the night and has a sudden urge to vomit. Patient states that his symptoms usually do okay first thing in the morning but seem to get worse throughout the day. He is currently taking pantoprazole once a day in the morning. When his symptoms flareup, he will often take Tums which provides some relief. He denies any recent changes in his diet or routine. No dysphagia or odynophagia. Patient has been evaluated for ongoing cough recently, but he was told that it may also be related to acid reflux. Patient continues to smoke cigarettes on a daily basis. Patient also reports having intermittent loose stools. He has not found any specific foods that trigger it. He typically only has 1-2 bowel movements a day, but it will go back and forth between solid stools and more loose stools. His last colonoscopy in 2019 was normal and he was recommended to repeat in 10 years.

Assessment:
67-year-old male seen today for follow-up on epigastric pain, acid reflux, and bloating/gas. Patient has history of Barrett's esophagus. He will be due for surveillance EGD later this year. Given his worsening in symptoms at this time, recommended that we proceed with EGD now. Advised him to continue pantoprazole daily. We discussed addition of famotidine to his routine, especially to help with nocturnal symptoms. Patient is agreeable to try famotidine and proceed with EGD. We also discussed some dietary triggers that may be making his bloating, gas, and intermittent diarrhea worse. We discussed trial of low FODMAP diet to see if it helps with any of the symptoms. We also discussed some over-the-counter medications which may help including Beano or Gas-X. Additionally, we will rule out any abnormality such as H. pylori or celiac disease on endoscopy. Patient continues to smoke cigarettes on a daily basis. Reinforced importance of smoking cessation, especially given his history of Barrett's esophagus and increased risk for development of esophageal cancer in patients with history of tobacco use.

History of Present Illness:
Maria Korte is a 67 year old female patient who is seen today for an initial visit.  This patient was sent by Dr. Sameer Mohiuddin for acid reflux. The patient recently had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. There is a history of a colonoscopy done in Austin in March 2024. It was an Austin GI doctor that referred her for the cholecystectomy.
The patient was last seen in TDDC by Dr. Ilyas Memon in Conroe in March 2019 when the patient was being treated for constipation and reflux. The patient was being given nitroglycerin cream for rectal pain and was on Nexium 20 mg a day for reflux. They said there was a history of colon polyps and had recommended a follow-up colonoscopy in 3 years. There was an EGD and colonoscopy done in March 2018 where there was an adenomatous colon polyp but there was no Barrett's. There was not a biopsy of the stomach looking for intestinal metaplasia or Helicobacter.  In 2018, at least, they did not see a hiatal hernia.
She had an EGD in March 2025 by Dr. Tarkan Dural in the Woodlands. He told her she had a small hiatal hernia. There had been a CT scan earlier in the year that did also show a small hiatal hernia and some diverticulosis. There had even been an MRI in April that showed some liver cyst but no stones. The reason her gallbladder was taken out was because a CCK study showed biliary dyskinesia but did not show stones. Otherwise they would not have done a stimulated gallbladder study.
The EGD in March 2025 showed acid reflux. The patient used to be on Nexium but someone told her to stop it because it might affect her liver which is not true. Part of what was happening was that she was getting attacks of severe epigastric distress, nausea, and dysphagia. She would be eating a solid piece of meat and then she would feel nauseated and feel foam coming back up, have to stop eating, leave the room, and then it may clear in about 20 minutes. This was being called a gallbladder symptom. At the EGD, though, there was a stricture of her distal esophagus that was not dilated. Since her gallbladder surgery, she has continued to have occasional episodes of this discomfort.
She has irritable bowel constipation for years. Before her surgery, she was taking Trulance which she thought made her feel bad and did not really help. She would go 5 days between a bowel movement. Since her surgery, she is having a spontaneous bowel movement about every other day so she is pretty happy about that. She knows she had a colonoscopy but she did not realize it was as far back as 2018 and there has not been another. She was not aware that she had a precancerous adenoma. She really hates the idea of a colonoscopy prep because she threw it all up before, it was an inadequate prep, her blood pressure went up, and she did not ever want to have a colonoscopy again. She has a history of anal fissures and even got Botox injections into the anal sphincter in 2019. However, with the knowledge of having an adenoma, she is willing to go forward with another colonoscopy if we can make the prep easy.

Assessment:
Her main symptoms today are symptoms that sound a lot like esophageal meat impactions. I was suspecting that before we were able to come up with the records from her last endoscopy. Indeed, they said took pictures of an esophageal stricture, even mentioned it as a diagnosis. I think she needs an EGD with dilation. We probably should put her back on Nexium every day because reflux could make a stricture more recalcitrant. Initially I was trying to avoid doing another EGD but the records show that she has a stricture and the comments in the endoscopy report from March 2025 mention a stricture. I think we need to do an EGD with dilation because I think that is what is the cause of her symptoms.
She also needs a colonoscopy. She is very reluctant because she had such a rough experience with this in 2018. Hopefully we can make it a little more pleasant by giving her a Gatorade MiraLAX cleanout and maybe magnesium citrate 2 days out. I think it was her inability to finish the prep that led to a bad prep and then enemas and a lot of discomfort. Hopefully we can make this a better experience but she is 7 years out on her colon adenoma and it needs to be rechecked.
She has irritable bowel syndrome constipation. Right now she feels okay with a bowel movement every other day. She does not like Trulance. Hopefully we will not have to think of anything else.
Plan:	We will do a 2-day cleanout starting with a bottle of magnesium citrate 2 nights before the colonoscopy, then the Gatorade MiraLAX cleanout on the night before the colonoscopy.

History of Present Illness:
I did a screening colonoscopy in 2019 which was normal except for moderate hemorrhoids and diverticulosis.
I reviewed an office note from Dr. Griffin from June which states patient has received IVIG for ITP in the past. S/P ORIF Jan 2025 with post-op extensive DVT requiring thrombectomy x2 and stent as well as PE treated with Eliquis and Plavix. Hemoglobin was 11.7 and ferritin was 17 which is mildly low. They discussed this may be related to his surgery but should also consider endoscopic evaluation. He tells me he was able to stop his Plavix back in June. He was started on iron at that time and does not think he has had follow-up blood work. He does tell me his stools are black and he thinks this started before he started oral iron. However he has chronic constipation and only has a hard stool 3 times a week. He uses Advil 400 mg approximately twice a week and denies other NSAIDs. He denies other gastrointestinal or bowel symptoms.

History of Present Illness:
Billi Farris is a 47 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit.
This a 45-year-old female who was sent over by Dr. Mohandas for evaluation of abdominal pain. She tells me that she has had chronic left lower quadrant pain that comes and goes but its been constant now for about 2 months. She says it does not change with eating and does not change with a bowel movement its always there at times it gets real bad and extends down her leg and her leg gets numb. She does have a history of some endometrial thickening on ultrasound and has had a cervical cancer and a conization and she is pending a further GYN evaluation. She tells me that she has regular stools 2-3 times a day with no blood no melena and her weight has been stable. She had a colonoscopy in 2018 with apparently an adenoma and her sister had polyps and she is due for colonoscopy.
The patient has had about 5 years of reflux she was scoped forward apparently 2018 and they just found reflux and reportedly no H. pylori and she has been on omeprazole since that time. She varies between 20 mg and 40 mg and it is better at the 40 mg dose. She says she feels a heartburn almost all day long. She is not having any dysphagia. Her weight has been stable.
+++3/14/2024 NP Harpe:
At her last visit, colonoscopy was recommended for consistent low quadrant pain does not change with eating or bowel movements patient did have a CT that was unremarkable other pain is more consistent with GYN or nerve issues as pain get worse when she extended her leg. However a colonoscopy was recommended to rule out any GI component. Results are as follows:
9/13/2023: Colonoscopy: Internal hemorrhoids, otherwise normal.
Today she reports her pain is inconsistent and occurs when she is having constipation. She does now realize she was taking her dicyclomine wrong, only taking this once instead for TID as recommended. She now has run out. She feels without the medication her abdominal pain with constipation is more intense. She does continue to cycle with constipation with no stool for a few days then loose stools every 3-4 days (with 3-4 each day).. She does feel dicyclomine makes her stools regular and her abdominal pain subside.. She has tried fiber supplementation and gluten free and she feels this is marginally helpful. No melena or hematochezia.
Additionally, at her last visit she was switched from omeprazole to pantoprazole 40 mg daily for GERD symptoms. Today she reports this is working well for her symptoms, only symptomatic once a week with greasy food. No dysphagia.
+++6/7/2024 NP Harpe:
At her last visit her GERD was stable with pantoprazole daily. Today she reports she continues with this therapy and is asymptomatic. No dysphagia.
Additionally, at her last visit we did discuss and encourage a bowel regimen to fix constipation. She was unsure if she wanted to proceed with this, first wanting to try dicyclomine 3 times daily to manage her LLQ abdominal discomfort. Today she reports she did use the dicyclomine and found this helpful. She is now taking this every 4-6 hours if she has pain. She did not try the bowel regimen and is now having a bowel movement daily that is pebbles to soft and formed. No melena or hematochezia.
++Office Visit 9/12/2025 w/PA Najar:
Last office visit 6/7/2024. Weight was 182.2 and now 186#.
Patient has a history of reflux. Reportedly endoscopy completed 2018.
Patient reports pantoprazole 40 mg works well to control symptoms. Denies any frequent breakthrough indigestion, heartburn or difficulty swallowing. Pt reports that she recently ran out but few months before, she was having breakthrough acid once a week. It would happen in morning and if she was bending over a lot. Eats at 5:30pm last meal. Reclines at 11pm. Caffeine 2 cans of Mountain Dew or Coke most days. She admits she has gained wt and she thinks this is contributing.
As far as bowel habits–patient reports that she takes dicyclomine BID for cramping. She has 2-3 BMs a day. Rare constipation. She gets cramping if she comes off dicyclomine.
Last colonoscopy September 2023. She has a personal history of colon polyps and also father with colon polyp history.

Assessment:
Patient is having heartburn breakthrough about once a week. We did discuss cutting back caffeinated carbonated sodas and working on weight loss. Otherwise the GERD symptoms appear to be well-controlled on current PPI regimen.
Bowels are moving well and dicyclomine helps with abdominal cramping. She has tried to wean off and the cramping returns. We did review the side effect profiles of dicyclomine and proton pump inhibitor long-term. Patient is doing well we will see her back annually, unless sooner as needed.
Plan:	Renew dicyclomine 10 mg Take 1 capsule by mouth twice a day with meals
Renew pantoprazole 40 mg Take 1 tablet by mouth once a day 30 min before breakfast
Monitor clinical course and call with any problems or worsening symptoms in the interim.
Follow-up office visit in 1 year
Potential side effects of a PPI were discussed with patient regarding long-term safety.
Adhere to lifestyle and dietary modifications for GERD diet as we discussed. This includes avoiding fatty and greasy foods, fried foods, tomato based foods, caffeine, carbonated drinks, coffee and alcohol. Elevate the head of your bed 6 inches. Additionally, do not eat or drink anything including water within two hours of going to bed at night or 10pm, whichever comes first. Recommend low fat, low cholesterol diet and exercise.

Right nephrectomy planned for 11-6-2025
Dysphagia resolved after esophageal dilation in April
History of Present Illness:
This is a non-billed telemedicine visit, rating specifically to discuss recent abnormal MRI.
I last saw the patient back in April. She was coming in at that time for dysphagia and family history of colon cancer. EGD revealed a small paraesophageal hernia. Her Nissen fundoplication look good. Empiric dilation was done to 54 French. Colonoscopy was normal.
Since the patient was in for endoscopy, she was found to have a mass lesion on the right kidney. This measures 2.3 cm in size. She has seen 2 urologist about this, and it sounds like it is felt to most likely be renal cell carcinoma. She has surgery planned for November 6. The plan is to remove one third of the kidney but if there is significant bleeding or other complication she may need to have complete nephrectomy.
Patient has been requested to have her pancreas evaluated, if possible before surgery. She has seen her established surgeon Dr. Bayouth and he referred her here for EUS. Of interest, Dr. Bayouth's father was her physician in Lubbock.
At this time patient reports doing well. She denies any jaundice, severe abdominal pain. Her dysphagia is totally resolved after dilation. She is not aware of any significant pancreas history.
Details of our visit today:

Assessment:
Patient is referred back for abnormal MRI showing a 6 mm cystic lesion within the head of the pancreas, in close proximity to the pancreatic duct. This was seen on MRI of the abdomen with and without contrast performed on August 13, 2025 at Midtown imaging. I have recommended endoscopic ultrasound for most definitive assessment, particularly in light of upcoming planned nephrectomy for suspected renal cell carcinoma. I discussed the procedure at length today with the patient including risks, benefits, limitations, alternatives, and she is in agreement and ready to proceed. She is not taking any medications other than estrogen.

History of Present Illness:
Linda Hall is a 76 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit.
Follow-up 3/9/2023, Diocares:
She reports she continues to eat foods with mild dysphagia. Denies having any significant trouble swallowing. Admits it is difficult to know if she needs to have another dilation. Prior dilation was in October 2022 and performed savory dilation of the proximal esophageal stricture up to 45 French. She does have Barrett's in the lower esophagus, confirmed by biopsies, no dysplasia. Denies having any chest pain, nausea, vomiting, weight loss. She admits she is avoiding spicy foods, coffee, and eating within 3 to 4 hours of bedtime, which she admits is a little challenging but this is helped her manage her GERD and dysphagia. Admits she never had GERD symptoms but due to the esophageal stricture, history of Barrett's esophagus, we know she has silent GERD. She is staying active.
Follow-up 7/25/2023:
She has noticed in the last few weeks has been having dysphagia with rice and bread. Last EGD was on 4/19/2023 which showed T known upper esophageal stricture and had dilation of 40-45 French. Also had known lower third of esophagus Barrett's esophagus and moderate hiatal hernia. She continues to take her PPI twice daily.
+++1/10/2024 NP Harpe:
At her last visit, an EGD with dilation was recommended for previous findings of esophageal stricture. It was likely needed every 3 to 6 months in order to prevent food impaction and dysphagia. It was recommended she take PPIs twice daily and avoid NSAIDs. Results of her previous EGD are as follows:
8/16/2023: EGD: Normal duodenum, mucosa suggestive of Barrett's esophagus, hiatal hernia, gastritis, stricture in the lower third of the esophagus dilated. No pathology.
Today she reports she is having dysphagia with non coated pills and meats. She feels these are sluggish despite small well chewed bites. No issues with liquids. No choking or coughing. Previous dilation is helpful.
She continues to take Pantoprazole BID with no GERD symptoms. She does avoid late night eating. She does sleep elevated.
++++ 7/3/2024 Office Visit PA Despault:
Patient is here to discuss dysphagia. Last office visit 1/10/2024 patient was seen for dysphagia, esophageal stenosis and Barrett's without dysplasia GERD.  EGD 2/8/2024 positive for esophageal candidiasis. Stenosis upper third of esophagus status post dilation. Medium sized hiatal hernia. Pathology positive for candidiasis negative for intestinal metaplasia.
Patient was treated with fluconazole 200 mg 2 tablets by mouth day 1 then 1 by mouth every day for 14 days.  She had been on antibiotics and Orencia.
The patient is seen for evaluation of dysphagia which started 3 months ago.  Difficulty with swallowing has occurred intermittently with solids. Symptoms have been progressive with time. Food seems to get stuck in the suprasternal area. Dysphagia occurs at least once daily. Associated complaints include epigastric pain. Conditions relevant to this patient's dysphagia include known esophageal stricture, hiatal hernia and Barrett's esophagus. Prior treatment has included acid suppressing medication and dietary modification. To this point the patient has had recent EGD with dilation to evaluate this problem.
+++9/9/2025 Stephenson f/u: Pt presents for annual visit. He has been having EGDs with dilation every 6-8 weeks since mid 2024 and prior to that she was having EGDs 1-2 times a year. Her next EGD is scheduled 109/2025. She says that dysphagia has gradually improved since she has been getting regular dilation.
She has Barrett's esophagus. She takes pantoprazole 40 mg BID. Last EGD with Barrett's surveillance biopsies was 5/2025.
Today she has complaint of incontinence of stool. She says she went to a specialist years ago and she was told she had relaxation of the anal sphincter. She was told to take fiber. She has not been taking any fiber. She regularly has leakage of stool. She has formed BMs that are firm to soft. She does not have diarrhea.

378,09-09-2025,3883039,99214,K21.9,Z12.11,R07.9,Z80.0,"Chief Complaint:	Colorectal Cancer Screening
History of Present Illness:
This is a 60-year-old female presenting for a consultation regarding a screening colonoscopy. This is prompted by a recent diagnosis of rectal cancer in one of her sisters. They report their sister, who is three years younger, was recently diagnosed with rectal cancer and underwent a lower anterior resection on 08/21/2025. The sister is currently recovering from surgery and is expected to resume chemotherapy post-recovery. The patient has six living sisters and understands the need for increased surveillance due to this first-degree relative history. They report having an upper endoscopy in 2020 and another one since then due to a sensation of something being stuck, which was reportedly clear. They have never had a colonoscopy before. They are currently taking amitriptyline 25 mg, which is prescribed by their primary care provider for functional chest pain. They report their PCP has been managing this and has been performing EKGs. They were counseled on the potential cardiac side effect of QT prolongation associated with amitriptyline and the importance of regular EKG monitoring. They plan to discuss this with their PCP, Dr. Khan, at their next appointment in October. They deny any current gastrointestinal symptoms.
Prior Tests Reviewed:
- Upper endoscopy in 2020, reportedly normal.
- A subsequent upper endoscopy for dysphagia, which was reportedly normal.
4/17/2023 This is a telehealth visit being conducted at the request of patient from my office using audio connection. Appropriate informed consent was obtained. This is a follow-up visit. Patient has no complaints today, she has been feeling well She still takes amitriptyline 25mg QHS and famotidine 40mg BID with resolution of chest discomfort, abdominal discomfort, and heartburn. Today, she denies abdominal pain, N/V, change in appetite, constipation, diarrhea, black or bloody stools. Patient completed Cologuard last year, which was negative. She has not had EKG done in over 1 year. Recommended repeating EKG. Plan to follow up in one year.
3/1/2022 She is here for follow-up. She reports improvement in chest pain while she is on amitriptyline and reports no side effects. She is also on famotidine twice a day with the control of her symptoms. She has an appointment with her cardiologist next week, I recommended that she get an EKG and fax us the report. We are looking for QT prolongation. She had a Cologuard test done last month with her PCP which was reportedly normal and she will send us a report.
08/10/2021 This is a follow-up. Patient states that her chest pain is completely resolved with amitriptyline 25 mg and she is happy with the results. She denies any side effects particularly constipation. Her last EKG shows normal QT without any prolongation, recommend that she gets an EKG either with her PCP or her cardiologist at least once a year, sooner if there is any change in medication dose. Heartburn is controlled with famotidine twice a day and we will refill the same. I did recommend colon cancer screening, she is somewhat hesitant to get a colonoscopy but she will strongly consider it prior to next visit.
05/06/2021  She is here for routine follow-up. Chest pain symptoms remain controlled with amitriptyline 25 mg dose. She had a recent EKG with cardiologist which she brought in today for review and was unremarkable. She is off the Flovent as instructed but remains on half dose of AcipHex with some associated dysphagia. Denies any typical heartburn or reflux sensation. We discussed possibility of side effects associated with long-term PPI use and she is interested in trying an alternative treatment. I have prescribed twice daily H2 blocker which she may use for the time being. If symptoms worsen will consider returning to PPI use. Recommend continue current dose of amitriptyline. No prior screening colonoscopy in the past which we have discussed in detail today. Patient is hesitant to undergo endoscopy and has a busy schedule. We also discussed the risk and benefits of Cologuard test which she is interested in and will obtain from her PCP. She understands if Cologuard test is positive she will need a diagnostic colonoscopy at that time.
11/30/2020 This is a telehealth visit being conducted at the request of patient from my office using audio connection. Appropriate informed consent was obtained. This is a follow-up visit. Patient was started on amitriptyline for atypical reflux symptoms as well as atypical chest pain with a negative GI and cardiac work-up. She notes almost 100% relief from symptoms. She is extremely happy with the outcome. I recommend that she can stop Flovent since there is no evidence of eosinophilic esophagitis on esophageal biopsies. In addition I have also asked her to wean off rabeprazole since she does not have typical symptoms of reflux or evidence of reflux esophagitis on endoscopy. Side effects of amitriptyline including constipation as well as QT prolongation was discussed. Her baseline EKG was within normal limits. I recommended that she obtain an EKG with her cardiologist in 3 months and fax the results to us. Audio time 25 mins.
10/30/2020 She is here for routine follow-up. Discussed most recent EGD findings including abnormal lower esophageal sphincter, Hill grade 2. Mild gastritis, biopsies negative for H. pylori. Normal mucosa throughout esophagus and biopsies not consistent with eosinophilic esophagitis. She remains on Flovent as well as AcipHex. She did not take amitriptyline that was prescribed at her last visit. She did try the sublingual Levsin however did not benefit and discontinued since. Her main symptoms are palpitations which tend to occur in the evenings and intermittent chest tightness. She has had very extensive cardiac work-up including 30 day Holter monitor. She was recently started on 25 mcg Synthroid by an endocrinologist due to newly diagnosed hypothyroidism. She denies any dysphagia, reflux, nausea, vomiting, or altered bowel habits. Discussed trial of TCA given unexplained chest pain, atypical reflux symptoms as well as insomnia. Risks and benefits of medications were discussed. She had a thorough cardiac work-up. If she does remain on this long-term we will consider getting EKG at regular intervals to check for QTc prolongation. I have also offered her esophageal manometry to evaluate for esophageal spasms but she wants to hold off on further testing at this point. If symptoms persistent she wants to proceed we will do esophageal manometry in future.
10/13/2020 This is a telehealth visit being conducted at the request of patient from my office using bidirectional synchronous video communication tool. Appropriate informed consent was obtained. She called in again requesting an appointment. She was just seen yesterday via an audio appointment. She now reports lower abdominal pain which has started 2 weeks ago and she forgot to mention this yesterday. Pain is dull achy persistent. She denies any altered bowel habits such as diarrhea constipation or rectal bleeding. Denies she continues to have trouble with nutrition states that she has nausea and it hurts when she eats so she reduced her oral intake and apparently has lost some weight as well. She is tried some nutritional supplements but that cause discomfort so she is talking to a friend who is a nutritionist to get supplements. She did try 1 dose of hyoscyamine sublingual for esophageal spasms. States that it has not helped her. She was previously on Zoloft and it was discontinued due to nausea. She was also on clonazepam as needed and she continues to take this which does help. We discussed possibility of irritable bowel syndrome exacerbated by stress and anxiety. I have recommended a short course of a try cyclic antidepressant to see if this would help with the GI component of her pain. Side effects including constipation, sleepiness and dry mouth were discussed. She has an appointment next week for an upper endoscopy to reevaluate for eosinophilic esophagitis and possible repeat biopsies and she plans to keep that appointment. I recommended a colonoscopy when she is able to tolerate prep and her nutritional status improves.
10/12/2020 This is a telehealth visit being conducted at the request of patient from my office using audio connection. Appropriate informed consent was obtained. Since last visit patient has sent multiple electronic messages that she continues to have atypical chest discomfort and palpitations. She notes that she had various cardiac evaluations and was negative. She reports waking up at nighttime with palpitations. She reports past prandial chest tightness and upper abdominal discomfort. She has been on AcipHex with no improvement in symptoms. We have scheduled her for repeat upper endoscopy next week for repeat esophageal biopsies. She did notice that some of her chest tightness symptoms have improved since taking Flovent inhaler for suspected eosinophilic esophagitis. However this does not explain her abdominal symptoms as well as palpitations. She did visit with her primary care physician and is undergoing work-up for thyrotoxicosis as well as hormonal work-up for postmenopausal symptoms. She did have menopause about 9 years ago. With respects to possible esophageal spasms I recommended starting a course of Levsin sublingual as needed and consideration for a barium esophagram after the endoscopy if symptoms persist. Audio 25 mins.
10/07/2020: This is a telehealth visit being conducted at the request of patient from my office (11920 Astoria Blvd, St 410, Houston 77089) using audio only communication since video is unavailable. Patient complains of new onset nausea, dyspepsia, and palpitations x 1 week. She actually went back to the emergency department on Monday,Sugarland Methodist, where she had extensive work-up including angiogram which was reportedly negative. Labs and imaging not available for review however these were within normal limits per patient who seems to be a very good historian. No abdominal imaging was performed per patient. As discussed during her previous visit she still experiences some chest tightness which has been attributed to GERD and recently diagnosed eosinophilic esophagitis. After her last visit she discontinued budesonide capsules and has been using Flovent 2 puffs held in mouth and swallowed twice a day. She was also recently started on Zoloft by her primary care provider approximately 10 days ago for treatment of anxiety. I have informed patient that it is possible that Zoloft could be contributing to her new onset nausea and worsening palpitations however Flovent could cause palpitations as well. She also recently discontinued clonazepam however she was not taking this long-term, only used for 5 to 6 days total. Patient states she cut the Zoloft tablet in half last night and noticed a slight improvement in nausea today. She will continue 25mg dose for now if her PCP is agreeable. At this time her nausea is likely prohibitive of completing colon prep. Recommend Mylanta as needed in addition to aciphex, bland and/or liquid diet as tolerated. We will reschedule EGD alone to sooner available time. Patient is agreeable with this plan of care. Total time spent in evaluation via tele visit was 25 mins.
9/28/20 She is here as a new patient with a diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis. She started noticing chest discomfort and food impactions recently. In fact she went to the emergency room after an episode of food impaction with the chest pain had comprehensive cardiac evaluation. Subsequently she was referred to GI and underwent an upper endoscopy. She brought in reports which revealed the linear furrows and corrugated mucosa suggestive of eosinophilic esophagitis. Biopsies were taken from GE junction as well as midesophagus with elevated eosinophilic count more than 24 high-power field suggestive of eosinophilic esophagitis. She was started on AcipHex by her primary care physician and was also started on oral budesonide capsules. She started doing an elimination diet in fact lost quite a bit of weight from it. She does notice some altered bowel habits and abdominal discomfort after eating milk products. She was previously not lactose intolerant. She denies any environmental allergies. She has never had a colonoscopy. We discussed the natural history and treatment options for eosinophilic esophagitis. I have recommended that we stop the oral budesonide and discussed either inhaled Flovent steroid or a liquid viscous budesonide to swallow both of which worked very well for eosinophilic esophagitis. She wants to try the inhaler first and if not consider the liquid budesonide. I recommended repeat EGD with dilation as well as repeat biopsies in 6 weeks time. She also wants to proceed with a screening colonoscopy at the same time. Risks and benefits of the procedures were discussed. In addition I have recommended a referral to an allergist for formal allergy testing. I discussed alternative treatments including a 6 food alimentation diet.

Family history of colon cancer
Assessment:
1. Colon cancer screening - Z12.11
- Due to a first-degree relative (sister) with rectal cancer, a screening colonoscopy is indicated. The patient has no personal history of colon polyps or colon cancer.
- Plan for screening colonoscopy. The procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed, including the need for bowel preparation the day prior and the requirement for a driver. The procedure will be performed on a Friday at the local surgery center. It was explained that if polyps are found, they will be removed during the procedure. If the examination is normal, the recommended interval for repeat colonoscopy is every five years due to the family history.
2. Functional chest pain - R07.89
- The patient has a history of functional chest pain managed with amitriptyline 25 mg, prescribed by their PCP.
- Discussed the potential cardiac side effect of QT prolongation with amitriptyline and the necessity for regular EKG monitoring. The patient will discuss the ongoing management and monitoring of this medication with their PCP. If their PCP is not comfortable managing this, I have offered to take over the prescription, which would require at least annual follow-up visits.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 58-year-old male patient here to see me for evaluation of dysphagia and for a screening colonoscopy.
He reports experiencing hiccups for approximately the last year. Over the past few months, he has developed dysphagia to the point where he occasionally has to induce vomiting to relieve the sensation of food being stuck. He denies any recent changes in medications, supplements, or recent infections that could be related to the onset of these symptoms. He reports a history of violent coughing episodes during the COVID-19 pandemic and wonders if this may have caused mechanical damage. He denies current symptoms of heartburn or reflux, though he notes a remote history of reflux that is not currently an issue. He does not take any antacid medications. He reports a past history of blood in the stool, but this has resolved and is not a current complaint.
He has no known past medical or surgical history. He has no known cardiac or pulmonary history. There is no history of complications with prior endoscopic procedures or anesthesia.
There is no family history of colon cancer, though he is unsure if any family members have had polyps. Social history was not discussed in detail.

Diagnoses:	Encounter for screening colonoscopy
Dysphagia (e)
Assessment:
1. Dysphagia: The primary concern is dysphagia with occasional need for induced emesis, suggesting a significant esophageal obstruction. The leading differential diagnosis is a Schatzki ring, which is a ring of scar tissue in the lower esophagus, potentially secondary to a hiatal hernia and silent gastroesophageal reflux. The chronicity of symptoms and the need to regurgitate food suggest a tight stenosis. An inflammatory process is also a consideration. Other causes of obstruction are less likely but will be evaluated. An alternative plan involving imaging studies was discussed but an EGD is the preferred initial step to directly visualize and potentially treat the issue.
2. Colon cancer screening: The patient is due for his first screening colonoscopy.
Plan:
- An Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is planned to evaluate the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, specifically to investigate the cause of his dysphagia. If a stricture or Schatzki ring is found, dilation will be performed at the same time.
- A screening colonoscopy will be performed concurrently with the EGD to evaluate for polyps or other pathology. Any polyps identified will be removed for histopathological evaluation.
- The risks and benefits, preparation, and procedural details were discussed and any questions were answered.
- Labs ordered as below
- Follow-up will be determined by the findings of the procedures. The results will be communicated to the patient.
The patient has verbally consented to the use of a virtual scribe.

Suflave 178.7-7.3-0.5 gram Drink 1 bottle by mouth, twice a day, split dose per prep instructions
Additional Notes:	After Visit Summary:
*   We discussed your symptoms of food getting stuck, which are concerning for a blockage in your esophagus (food pipe). We also discussed that it is time for you to have your first colon cancer screening.
*   The plan is to perform two procedures at the same time: an upper endoscopy (EGD) to look at your esophagus and stomach, and a colonoscopy for colon cancer screening.
*   During the EGD, if we find a narrowing, we will stretch it open to help relieve your swallowing problems. During the colonoscopy, if we find any polyps, we will remove them.
*   You will be sedated for the procedures and will not feel anything. You will need someone to drive you home afterward.
*   The most important part of the preparation is cleaning out your colon the day before. You will be given a kit with a special liquid to drink and detailed instructions. Please follow the diet and drinking instructions exactly as provided.

History of Present Illness:
Homer Sarty is a 77 year old male who is seen today for a follow-up visit.   Patient is here for clinic follow-up. Upper GI endoscopy and a colonoscopy done. On EGD patient was found to have superficial ulcerations with black eschar. Biopsies obtained and are negative for dysplasia or Helicobacter pylori. Interestingly present biopsies do not show any evidence of intestinal metaplasia.Duodenal biopsies were obtained which are consistent with clinically suspected localized lymphangiectasia. Patient on questioning denies any use of NSAIDs, states takes baby aspirin and uses extra-strength Tylenol for analgesia. Patient also underwent a colonoscopy in which he was found to have small tubular adenomas. He was also found to have moderate diverticular disease. Colon prep was somewhat limited.

Assessment:
Colon polyps: Patient was found to have benign tubular adenomas and present colonoscopy. Considering somewhat limited prep repeat colonoscopy is recommended in 5 years.
Erosive gastropathy/superficial ulcers: Possibility of injury related to the prep for the colonoscopy, though black eschar raises concern for more chronicity.
Patient will be treated with high-dose PPI for 2 months at that point a repeat endoscopy will be done. Also has prior reported history of intestinal metaplasia but present biopsies do not show any metaplasia.
Diverticulosis I counseled the patient regarding the pathophysiology and management of diverticular disease.

Assessment:
Cristina is a 40-year-old white female with history of factor V Leiden deficiency complicated by Budd Chiari syndrome with resultant cirrhosis status post TIPS complicated by ascites currently on combination diuretic therapy with furosemide and spironolactone. We reviewed her recent Doppler ultrasound of the liver noting a patent TIPS with no evidence of hepatic mass or ascites. Her renal function remains relatively stable although demonstrates evidence of CKD stage III, likely secondary to her ongoing diuretic therapy. We will continue with this along with her routine surveillance MELD labs (her most recent labs demonstrate a normal bilirubin of 0.6, a normal alkaline phosphatase of 64, and ALT of 22 and a mildly elevated AST of 34, AFP was normal at 1.9 with an INR of 2.0 and PTT of 21.3 on warfarin because of her coagulopathy). We reviewed her ultimate need for liver transplant and discussed possibilities to include a living donor versus deceased donor liver transplant and will continue to keep a close eye on her.
We also discussed her recent diagnosis with celiac disease. We will plan on surveillance celiac antibodies with her next set of labs. I did encourage her to become more strict with her gluten avoidance noting that untreated celiac disease could pose significant issues with malabsorption, reduced bone density, etc.

History of Present Illness:
Carlos Mendoza is a 64 year old male who is seen today for a follow-up visit. Patient has previously been seen for colonoscopy in July 2024. This was unremarkable and he was recommended to repeat in 10 years. Patient is now following up for worsening issues with acid reflux as well as unintentional weight loss earlier this year. Patient states that his weight was initially around 200 lbs. He got as low as 175 lbs over a several months. During that time, he was hospitalized 3 different times for issues related to kidney stones, so he is not sure if his weight loss was related to that. Over the last month or so, patient has started to gain some weight back and is currently at 185 on his home scale. Patient denies any abdominal pain however he has continued to experience some burning in his chest. He states that he often feels like his throat is ""hot."" He also reports dysphagia and globus sensation noting that it feels like he ""has a marble stuck in his throat.""  He thought that some of his symptoms may be related to his medications, so he stopped all of them for a few days but did not notice any changes in his symptoms. Patient also struggles with constipation. He states he can go up to a week without a bowel movement at times. When constipation is more severe, he will take stool softeners on an as needed basis which helps.

Assessment:
64-year-old male seen today for follow-up for recent worsening with burning in his chest as well as episodes of dysphagia and globus sensation. Patient has undergone EGD in the past but it has been nearly 30 years since this has been done. Given recent worsening in symptoms, recommended that we start pantoprazole and proceed with one-time EGD to rule out Barrett's esophagus, eosinophilic esophagitis, erosive esophagitis, large hiatal hernia, H. pylori, gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, etc. Discussed risk, benefits, and alternatives to EGD. Patient is agreeable to proceed at this time. Patient also has unintentional weight loss recently although this may have been related to multiple hospitalizations for kidney stones earlier this year. Overall his weight seems to be coming back up and stabilizing. Will continue to monitor at this time. Reassurance was provided that colonoscopy last year was unremarkable with no signs of colon polyps or other abnormalities. Patient also notes intermittent issues with constipation. Symptoms seem to improve with use of stool softeners. Advised that he consider taking stool softeners or MiraLAX on a daily basis along with adequate hydration and fiber intake to see how symptoms respond.

History of Present Illness:
Ernest Greenwood is a 68 year old male who is seen today for a follow-up visit.
Last visit 9/20/24: Mr. Greenwood is a very pleasant 67-year-old male that presents to clinic today for colonoscopy evaluation, as he is overdue for surveillance. Does have extensive history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation, for which he underwent watchman placement and has a pacemaker with defibrillator in place. Has been off of blood thinners for the past month under the direction of cardiologist. Denies other GI complaints. I discussed in detail with the patient the findings of his last colonoscopy and recent endoscopy (during hospitalization). Due to his history and multiple core morbidities, I believe it would be best for him to complete procedure at the hospital, of course with cardiac clearance. I believe it would be best to also undergo repeat endoscopy at that time given history of intestinal metaplasia. He understands the importance of contacting our clinic should he develop any symptoms concerning for more expedited evaluation such as melena, hematochezia, dysphagia, or odynophagia, to name a few.
EGD-Colonoscopy 2/3/25: Mild gastropathy (Chronic gastritis w/ no significant active inflammation, neg H.pylori, neg GIM), Several 6 mm polyps removed from stomach using cold snare (Benign hyperplastic polyp w/ focal active inflammation, neg H.pylori). Normal colonoscopy, small internal hemorrhoids.
Patient presents to clinic today for procedure follow-up. Underwent colonoscopy as he was overdue for screening as well as EGD given history of gastric intestinal metaplasia. Also history of PUD complicated by upper GI bleed requiring blood transfusion last year. Recent EGD with no evidence of PUD or gastric intestinal metaplasia. Colonoscopy unremarkable. Since his procedures, the patient reports feeling well today and denies GI complaints. Reflux currently well-managed with famotidine 40 mg daily. Has abstained from alcohol use for the past 6 months.

Assessment:
Mr. Greenwood Jr is a pleasant 68-year-old male who presents to clinic today for procedure follow-up. I discussed at length and in detail with the patient the findings of his EGD and colonoscopy, for evidence of gastric intestinal metaplasia for PUD. We discussed titrating down on famotidine to the lowest effective dose for management of his reflux. We also reviewed reflux lifestyle and dietary modifications, I do recommend continue abstaining from alcohol use. He verbalized understanding. He endorses a history of anemia, therefore we will request records from his PCP to monitor. Given that he is asymptomatic at today's visit, he would like to follow-up as needed, but understands on presenting for sooner evaluation should he develop any alarm symptoms that we discussed at length today. Time spent in counseling and/or coordination of care (including but not limited to reviewing prior records, arranging further services, communicating further with care providers) was at least 30 minutes with more than 50% of this time spent in face-to-face or direct telecommunication with the patient.
Plan:
Try to taper Famotidine 40 mg to the lowest effective dose/frequency
My office will obtain records from referring physician
Adhere to lifestyle and dietary modifications for GERD diet as we discussed. This includes avoiding fatty and greasy foods, fried foods, tomato based foods, caffeine, carbonated drinks, coffee and alcohol. Elevate the head of your bed 6 inches. Additionally, do not eat or drink anything including water within two hours of going to bed at night or 10pm, whichever comes first. Recommend low fat, low cholesterol diet and exercise.
Follow-up with me as needed
Additional Notes:	Thank you for the opportunity to care for Ernest"

400,09-12-2025,10135840,99204,R10.84,R19.7,Z12.11,,"Chief Complaint:	Diarrhea
History of Present Illness:
This is a 52-year-old female patient here for an initial visit to see me for evaluation of diarrhea and changing bowel habits that have been ongoing for approximately one year.
She reports episodes of diarrhea occurring on a weekly basis, often associated with diffuse, cramping abdominal pain that is migratory. The urgency to defecate can be sudden and severe, occurring immediately after or even during meals. She describes nocturnal episodes, with multiple bowel movements between 2 AM and 5 AM. The stool consistency progressively loosens during an episode, starting as formed but painful, then becoming mushy, and ultimately watery, corresponding to Bristol stool types 6 and 7. Between these episodes, she has some days with normal, formed stools. She has not noticed any blood in the stool or on toilet paper but admits she does not inspect the stool closely. There is no report of undigested food in the stool. She has attempted to keep a food diary but has not identified consistent triggers, with symptoms occurring after eating common foods such as rice, tomatoes, and chicken. She denies eating fast food, pizza, or burgers. However, she notes a specific Nigerian beef dish from a restaurant reliably induces severe symptoms.
She also reports constant reflux symptoms, which she describes as a sensation of phlegm in the throat requiring frequent throat clearing. This began after her second child. An ENT evaluation prior to 2017 suggested laryngopharyngeal reflux, not GERD. She reports her uvula feels irritated, as if it has been burned. She was advised to make dietary changes, such as eating only salad and fish without dressing, which she found impractical. No acid-suppressing medications were prescribed at that time.
She is not currently taking any medications. She has tried Flonase and Claritin in the past for her throat symptoms without relief.
Her past medical history is significant for a remote parasitic infection investigation while in college after moving from Africa, which was treated, resolving associated fevers. She denies any history of gastrointestinal issues or abdominal pain prior to the last year. A prior upper endoscopy was performed before 2017 for reflux evaluation, but she is unaware of the findings. There is no history of complications from procedures or anesthesia.
Family history is negative for gastrointestinal diseases. Her husband and daughter do not have similar issues. Social history is negative for tobacco, alcohol, IV drug use, or marijuana use. She has lived in Dallas since moving from Africa.

Diagnoses:	Abdominal pain, generalized (c)
Diarrhea (c)
Screening for colon cancer (c)
Assessment:
1. Chronic diarrhea (R19.7): The primary presenting complaint is chronic, intermittent, and painful diarrhea associated with food intake. The differential diagnosis includes infectious etiologies (parasitic, bacterial), inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn's disease, given the abdominal pain and chronicity), and irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D). Given her history of travel, an infectious cause must be ruled out. A colonoscopy is warranted for both diagnostic evaluation of the colonic mucosa and for age-appropriate colorectal cancer screening.
2. Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (K21.9): She reports persistent symptoms of a globus sensation and throat clearing, consistent with LPR. This appears to be triggered by environmental allergens (pollen) rather than acid reflux from the stomach. The physical finding of an irritated uvula supports ongoing inflammation in the pharynx.
Plan:
- Stool studies will be ordered to evaluate for infectious etiologies, including parasites.
- A colonoscopy will be scheduled to evaluate for inflammatory bowel disease, microscopic colitis, and for colorectal cancer screening. The risks and benefits, preparation, and procedural details were discussed and any questions were answered.
- Labs ordered as below.
- I am prescribing a trial of an antispasmodic medication to be taken before meals to help reduce abdominal cramping and fecal urgency.
- For laryngopharyngeal reflux symptoms, I recommended a trial of daily Claritin (tablet) in combination with Flonase spray, aimed at the oropharynx, for one month to assess response, particularly during seasonal changes.
- Follow-up will be scheduled after the colonoscopy and stool test results are available to discuss findings and further management.
- We discussed the possibility of using probiotics after the colonoscopy to help restore gut flora. We also discussed that if certain foods are identified as consistent triggers, they should be avoided.
The patient has verbally consented to the use of a virtual scribe.

History of Present Illness:
David Weeks is a 70 year old male patient who is seen today for an initial visit.  70-year-old male with history of left tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma status post radiation XRT and cisplatin therapy with last dose approximately 4 months ago underwent PEG placement back in March surgically done.  He reports chronic dysphagia to liquids and solids.  Dependent on PEG for food intake.  He is able to drink some liquids but coughs. He was evaluated by speech.
Speech note
Modified Barium Swallow Study (MBSS) revealed oral phase characterized by adequate lingual and labial strength and range of motion for tongue control, bolus preparation and transport. Lip closure was adequate with no labial escape. Bolus prep and mastication was timely and efficient. Lingual motion was brisk for adequate bolus transport. There was no significant oral residue. The swallow was initiated when the head of the bolus entered the vallecula.
Pharyngeal phase characterized by timely initiation of swallow across consistencies. The soft palate elevated for complete of the velopharyngeal port. During pharyngeal swallow, reduced base of tongue retraction, anterior hyoid excursion, laryngeal elevation, and pharyngeal stripping wave resulted in absent epiglottic inversion reduced UES opening with consistent penetration of varying depths during and after the swallow from residue, intermittent aspiration (both symptomatic and silent), and moderate to severe residue at the base of tongue, valleculae, pyriform sinuses, posterior pharyngeal wall, and level of the UES which was reduced with 3-4 spontaneous sequential swallows. Overall, movement of the laryngeal complex was significantly reduced resulting in impaired airway protection with absent epiglottic inversion with reduced pressures to adequately open the UES and allow passage of the bolus. Suspect lymphedema as a significant contributing factor to current deficits and presentation. Compensatory strategies such as supraglottic swallow and chin tuck were ineffective to prevent airway invasion. Effortful swallow was effective at reducing pharyngeal residue.
On esophageal screen, no significant findings were noted. There was, however, a large bony prominence in the cervical spine which appeared to be compressing into the upper esophagus.

Assessment:
The current ASGE guidelines regarding the management of anticoagulation medications in patients requiring an elective endoscopic procedure were discussed with the patient. Potential risks of continuing these medications include procedure related bleeding, while withholding of these meds may increase the risk of a potential thrombotic or embolic event. After discussing the potential risks and benefits with the patient, a decision has been reached to proceed with withholding of anticoagulation therapy. I have recommended to stop _ELIQUIS_ (medication) ___2_ days before the procedure. It was emphasized that aspirin should be maintained if this is an active medication. It was emphasized that aspirin 81 mgs should be maintained or added during the time off the anticoagulant or antiplatelet treatment.
Plan:	EGD at hospital with Anesthesia Provider/CRNA - 43235
Risks and benefits statement: The procedure and its preparation, benefits, alternatives, and limitations were explained to the patient or legal guardian. The risks and potential complications including but not limited to perforation, bleeding, infection, missed lesion, aspiration and other complications of sedation were reviewed. The patient or legal guardian verbalized understanding and wishes to proceed."

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 29-year-old female with past medical history is significant for anxiety and depression who presents to clinic today for evaluation of abdominal pain.
Patient reports a longstanding history of abdominal pain, however has been recently giving her more problems. She originally presented to ED at UT Southwestern for complaints of abdominal pain and vomiting. She had CT abdomen and pelvis performed which showed findings of acute gastritis with reactive lymphadenopathy as well as hepatic steatosis. There is also some concern for IUD dislodgment however this was not confirmed. At that time there was no CT imaging evidence of pancreatitis, however her lipase at that time was mildly elevated at 129 and was told that she has pancreatitis. Of note, patient endorses daily marijuana use with an electronic vape pen. She reports that she has been smoking almost daily since she was 19. She admits to frequently drinking alcohol. She does not drink daily, when she does it will be about a glass of wine or 2. She also uses an electronic cigarette regularly.
She was not hospitalized at Baylor Irving for similar symptomology. CT scan continues to show no evidence of pancreatic abnormalities indicating pancreatitis. Upon hospitalization at Baylor, her lipase was 41. No evidence of cholelithiasis on ultrasound. There was mention of semaglutide use during her hospitalization as well. However she also mentions that she was recommended to start Wegovy with her PCP but ultimately decided not to due to her suspected pancreatitis flares. Other labs at that time show WBC 8.9, H&H 11.7/37.1, MCV 94.2, platelet count 267,000, ALP 40, AST 12, ALT 10 and bilirubin 0.4. Her urine did show significantly elevated specific gravity of greater than 1.045, as well as trace ketones. Urine tox screen at that time did show evidence of fentanyl, opiates and THC. Patient denies any drug use, unsure whether patient received pain medications during hospitalization. She was discharged home on sucralfate, pantoprazole and famotidine.
At this time, patient is experiencing mild epigastric abdominal pain as well as nausea. She explains to me that the marijuana typically helps her stomach feel better. Since her hospitalization, she reports on attempting to cut back marijuana and alcohol use. She denies any melena, hematochezia, or change in bowel habits. She is currently only taking pantoprazole 40 mg once daily which has helped with her symptoms.

Assessment:
Patient is a 40-year-old white female new patient establishing care with our office. She reports a 20-year history of loose bowel movements, diarrhea 1-3 episodes after meals, chronic abdominal pain. She states approximately 20 years ago she had imaging of her gallbladder and was told that it with her bowel function was not normal, cholecystectomy was recommended at that time however she states she was young and did not follow through. Patient also had recent hospitalization in December at THR Denton for sepsis related to strep throat and pneumonia.
Patient states that she did not have any imaging of her abdomen at that time, thinks it was only her chest. She reports over the years she has tried multiple things for her symptoms including prebiotic, probiotic, apple cider vinegar, over-the-counter medications with no relief. She reports a typical days she has 6-10 loose bowel movements daily. She reports occasional bright red blood on the toilet paper approximately once a month when straining however no melena, no hematochezia, no rectal pain. Patient reports her abdominal pain is all day every day but is worse after meals. Pain is worse in right upper quadrant and left upper upper quadrant but also occurs daily in the lower abdomen. She reports it as a cramping type pain. Nothing makes the pain better or worse. She states she has seen her GYN in the last several months and they ruled out any GYN cause. She has never had any previous abdominal surgery. She denies any immediate family history of colon cancer however has several aunts and uncles with colon cancer. No family history of IBD, no liver disease, no esophageal or stomach cancer.
We discussed need for further workup on her diarrhea with stool studies to include fecal elastase and fecal calprotectin. Will order CT of her abdomen with contrast to evaluate her gallbladder as well as labs to assess for infection. Patient instructed to continue with her probiotic daily and to consider low FODMAP diet.

413,9/15/2025,1834340,99214,K21.9,R10.9,K57.30,K22.9,"Chief Complaint:	abdominal pain, diverticulitis found in CT at ER.
History of Present Illness:
Martha is a 73 yo female who had a positive cologuard in April 2025. She was last seen for EGD 02/26//2024. EGD showed a para esophageal hernia from 30-38 cm, mild duodenitis, ulcer in fundus within hernia, nodule at GE junction and pathology indicated no duodenal biopsies, no celiac. H. pylori negative gastritis, esophagitis no EE, no Barrett's or Candida.
She was referred to Dr. Bloemendal for the large hiatal hernia, and in that visit on 6/4/24, advised to undergo further diagnostic studies to evaluate esophageal motility and gastric emptying, which she did. However, she wanted to lose weight, so the surgical intervention was postponed until she had more weight loss. She began tirzepitide in December 2024 with Dr. Childers and will continue the medication until December 2025 as she is now in normal BMI and intentional weight loss in 150 lb range.. She has history of iron deficiency anemia as well.
She had a positive Cologuard in April 2025 and was referred to our office by Dr. Childers for further evaluation.
However, she went to the ER on 8/13/2025 for epigastric abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhea, and underwent CT abd/pelvis which showed moderate hiatal hernia,  colonic diverticulosis with sigmoid colonic wall thickening, likely sequalae of diverticulosis. No significant pericolonic inflammatory stranding to suggest acute diverticulitis. Mild diffuse hepatic steatosis. She was given 10 days of  Augmentin upon d/c from ER.
Last Sunday, she began to have diffuse lower abdominal pain with diarrhea and darker stools. She did not have any upper GI epigastric pain or symptoms. Did not have nausea, vomiting. She felt the stools were darker but were not completely dark melena but were darker in brown color than previously. She felt urgency to defecate. She had an older prescription of 10 days of Augmentin she had in the house left over from a previous sinus infection, so she has been taking these antibiotics and her symptoms are resolving.
Today she denies upper epigastric abdominal pain. She states she has no nausea with this round of lower abdominal pain. She did have some bloating and gas, but with the use of the antibiotics, this has dissipated.
She denies constipation.
There is no family history of colon cancer.
History of GERD. Denies dysphagia, hematemesis. She takes and pantoprazole and Zantac daily. At times she will take the pantoprazole BID, not daily to keep upper GI symptoms in control.

Positive colorectal cancer screening using Cologuard test
Abnormal finding on CT scan
Assessment:
Positive cologuard in April 2025: We will proceed with the diagnostic colonoscopy for evaluation of the positive Cologuard test. I reviewed the data from the pivotal study (N Engl J Med 2014; 370:1287-1297). Specifically, in patients with a positive Cologuard: 4% had colon cancer, 20% had advanced adenomas and 45% had no pathologic findings.
Acute diverticulitis per CT abd/pelvis: She has  diverticulosis complicated by diverticulitis as noted on previous CT scan imaging. We discussed the pathophysiology and natural history of diverticular disease. We focused our discussion on reducing such complications through a high fiber diet with OTC fiber supplementation along with limiting red meats and continued exercise. Per guidelines, given patient's recent episode of acute diverticulitis she should have a colonoscopy to assess for extent of diverticulosis and presence of persistent inflammation, as well as for additional lesions, including colorectal neoplasia and non-infectious colitis, which can produce similar symptoms. However, this is safest to be done 6 to 8 weeks after his episode to assure resolution of her diverticulitis prior to the procedure. This is in hopes of lowering risk of a potential complication, like perforation.
GERD:  She has typical symptoms of reflux disease. We discussed the pathophysiology and natural history of GERD. The patient is currently on PPI therapy daily versus BID and with Zantac daily with intermittent uncontrolled symptoms and. We discussed the indications for endoscopic evaluation to evaluate persistent symptoms despite PPI, screen for Barrett's esophagus, and assess for anatomical anomalies which may be contributing to symptoms. Lifestyle modifications and anti-reflux measures regarding GERD were discussed in detail. The long-term safety profile of PPI therapy was also discussed. Will continue to optimize the patient’s anti-reflux regimen with PPI with H2B as needed with a plan to down titrate to the lowest effective dose and/or change to an H2 Blocker alone for hopeful control of symptoms over time.
Plan:	Risks and benefits statement: The procedure and its preparation, benefits, alternatives, and limitations were explained to the patient or legal guardian. The risks and potential complications including but not limited to perforation, bleeding, infection, missed lesion, aspiration and other complications of sedation were reviewed. The patient or legal guardian verbalized understanding and wishes to proceed.
Adhere to lifestyle and dietary modifications for GERD diet as we discussed. This includes avoiding fatty and greasy foods, fried foods, tomato based foods, caffeine, carbonated drinks, coffee and alcohol. Elevate the head of your bed 6 inches. Additionally, do not eat or drink anything including water within two hours of going to bed at night or 10pm, whichever comes first. Recommend low fat, low cholesterol diet and exercise.
Initiate standing orders upon arrival to Endoscopy unit.
