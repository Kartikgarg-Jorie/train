Assessment:
Patient is a 74-year-old white female here accompanied by her husband for follow-up visit today. Patient has history of gastroparesis and chronic constipation. She recently had L4-L5 disc surgery with Dr. Catino on 7/9/25. She has history of chronic A-fib, breast cancer, type II DM, HTN, HLD, OSA, she has internal loop recorder and several previous ablations for recurrent her A-fib.
Patient reports that on Saturday she developed chest pain and presented to THR Denton for evaluation where she was admitted until 9/8/2025. She was treated for uncontrolled hypertension as well as CT of the abdomen and pelvis which revealed mild sigmoid diverticulitis or colitis. She was discharged home on Augmentin for 5 days. She reports that during her ER visit she was not having any abdominal pain, no diarrhea and no fever. We discussed that she has a history of diverticulosis on her last colonoscopy in 2021 and potential for development of diverticulitis. Patient states prior to ER visit and since being home she is more constipated. She states that due to her recent back surgery, pain medications, decreased mobility she has been having constipation and only having a bowel movement every 3 days. We discussed bowel regimen today to include MiraLAX and Benefiber. We also discussed need for colonoscopy in 8 weeks from her first episode of diverticulitis. Due to her recent back surgery and the fact that she has not been released for PT yet we will call the patient in a month and get an update on her symptoms.The goal would be to complete a colonoscopy in 8 weeks however this timeframe may need to be adjusted due to her mobility.
Patient and husband in agreement today no concerns, ER precautions reviewed.
Plan:
Recall in to call pt in 1 month with goal of colonscopy in 8 wks from today due to recent diverticulitis episode.
Follow-up with PCP for elevated blood pressure reading*
Diverticulitis, patient education materials generated by EMR
Gradual titration of fiber supplementation discussed (Benefiber, Metamucil, Citrucel.)

History of Present Illness:
Peggy Leblanc is a 75 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit. Last visit 06/24/2025. She presents today with chronic epigastric pain, SBO in November/December (on a background of narcotics, RSV, and GLP-1 use) which required 5 days hospitalization at Terrebonne with conservative treatment, and chronic constipation. Recent UGI with SBFT - reviewed with patient and husband today. Long term history of GERD which is under control with esomeprazole BID. She has been unable to tolerate skipping a dose of this in the past without rebound symptoms. Denies nausea, vomiting since bowel obstruction and discontinuing GLP-1 use. Denies dysphagia. She can have rare/intermittent mild epigastric discomfort described as a bloating discomfort. Belching and Dr Pepper intake resolves this. She is currently taking stool softener/MiraLAX daily and has daily bowel movements. Denies straining, frequent diarrhea, overt GI bleeding. Her weight is stable since last visit here but she did gain 10 pounds back with discontinuation of GLP-1. She is on baby aspirin, celebrex and cilostazol. Denies other NSAID use. She has chronic back pain and has pain pump with dilaudid since the 1990s. EGD x 2 in 2024 - incomplete due to food in stomach (she was on GLP-1 at this time). NGES 8/2024 ok. Last CT 6/2025. Prior CT 11/2024. She has had colonoscopies with Dr Birriel which was normal and up to date and recommendations to repeat in 10 years (which she reports will be when she is older than 80 and will not be interested) - no records. Recent diagnosis of emphysema with Dr Patten and she has inhalers for PRN use. She continues to follow Dr Arora at CIS in Thibodaux. DM is most under control right now with restarting metformin. She used to smoke, quit in 2006. Denies alcohol use. Long term history of chronic anemia - details are not exactly clear.

Chief Complaint:
(832) 720-9267-3m f/u, pt had to stop taking her wegovy due to vomiting and diarrhea,
History of Present Illness:
Jenna Boone is a 29 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit.In today's patient visit, Jenna Boon, a 29-year-old female with a history of ulcerative colitis treated with Entyvio infusions and post-pregnancy obesity, presented for a follow-up consultation via telehealth video conference. The primary concern was the management of Wegovy. She had been taking Wegovy for weight loss and successfully lost over 50 pounds. However, after her dose was increased to the highest level, 2.7 mg, she developed significant nausea and diarrhea, prompting her to discontinue the medication under the guidance of her primary care provider.
The patient expressed a desire to restart Wegovy as she felt it was very effective not only for weight loss but also observed that her acne, which had improved while on the medication, has returned since cessation. She also reports the return of ""food noise"" and acknowledges she is under significant stress due to family matters, which could also be a contributing factor to her acne. Her ulcerative colitis is quiescent, and she denies any bleeding or diarrhea related to it. Her last Entyvio infusion was recent, and the next one is scheduled for 09/16/2025.
Her previous primary care provider has left the practice, and she is scheduled to see a new nurse practitioner, Jancy Cherian, on 09/23/2025.

Assessment:
- Ulcerative Colitis: The condition is currently in remission with Entyvio infusions. There are no active symptoms such as bleeding or diarrhea.
- Obesity/Wegovy Management: The patient experienced significant weight loss with Wegovy but developed intolerable gastrointestinal side effects at the highest dose. Given the benefits, it is reasonable to attempt re-initiation of the medication. It has been agreed to restart at the initial low dose and titrate up gradually as tolerated. She was counseled that this approach is necessary due to being off the medication for several weeks. A note will be sent to her new primary care provider, Jancy Cherian, NP, to communicate this recommendation.
- Laboratory Evaluation: To monitor her underlying inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory markers will be checked via blood and stool testing.
Plan:
Complete Blood Count (CBC) with Diff
Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)
C-Reactive Protein (CRP)
Vitamin D, 1, 25 Dihydroxy
Fecal calprotectin
Follow-up office visit in 3 months
Continue current medications
Additional Notes:
Orders for a blood test and a stool test to check inflammatory markers have been placed.
The patient can have these tests done at Quest or on the same day as her upcoming infusion on 09/16/2025. A message will be sent to the medical assistant to ensure the collection kit is available for her at the infusion center.
It is recommended to restart Wegovy at the lowest initial dose and titrate upwards slowly as tolerated.
A note will be sent to her primary care provider, Jancy Cherian, NP, advising that it is gastroenterologically safe to restart Wegovy at a lower dose.
Follow up in three months to review progress and lab results."

History of Present Illness:
Carolyn Bussey is a 70 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit. She has history of fatty liver cirrhosis and esophageal varices. She is in office today for evaluation prior to EGD and banding of esophageal varices that is scheduled for tomorrow with Dr Barenberg. Her last EGD was on 2/1/24 and showed a normal esophagus and portal hypertensive gastropathy. Recall was advised in 1 year. She had seen a doctor in Houston in the last year due to insurance changes, but does not want to go there anymore. She is back on her old insurance now. She did not have any procedures done this year, she does not think. She has a some mild difficulty swallowing in the last 3 weeks. She tends to have gas/bloating. Has to watch what she eats. Has episodes of diarrhea depending on what she eats. Has to avoid spicy foods.  No blood or black stool. No nausea, vomiting, or epigastric pain. She notes that 6 months ago, she had passed really dark stool, but it stopped after a little while and did not return. She is prescribed Propranolol 10mg TID and states she only takes twice a day. No recent illness, procedure, or ER visit. Last ER visit was for her blood sugar several months ago.
Labs from July showed normal LFT's, Hgb 15.2, plt 71.
MRI 7/12/24 showed hepatic steatosis and cirhosis with splenomegaly, s/p cholecystectomy
She had a Colonoscopy 10/11/23 for personal history of colon polyps. Findings were a small hyperplastic polyp of the rectum and a few medium external hemorrhoids, no bleeding. Repeat colonoscopy in 7 years for surveillance purposes.

Cirrhosis/elevated AFP/esophageal varices: Patient remains well-compensated. MELD score cannot be calculated as recent labs are incomplete. AFP mildly elevated at 6.9 with follow-up MRI showed no liver mass or lesion. CMP with normal LFTs. Obtain additional labs and abdominal ultrasound. Patient is due for EGD to reassess for esophageal varices.
Colon cancer screening: Last colonoscopy in 2022 revealed three tubular adenomas measuring 4–10 mm with recommendations to repeat now. At that time, the patient was age 75, and we reviewed that routine colon cancer screening is generally discontinued between ages 75–80. He currently has no alarm symptoms and declines repeat colonoscopy, acknowledging the potential risks. This is reasonable give his age and comorbidities
Infrarenal AAA: Stable. Patient remains on low-dose aspirin 81 mg daily. Followed by vascular surgery.

1 year follow up, hemorrhoids
History of Present Illness:
Jana Hehs is a 62 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit.
This is a patient we see for GERD. Als has personal history of colon polyps. Last seen June 2024 by Dr. McMyler.
Her EGD in 2023 showed LA grade a esophagitis and we started her on omeprazole 20 mg once a day in the morning for 60 days with famotidine 40 mg at bedtime. Her symptoms did improve with the Omeprazole 20mg, but she does not want to be on a PPI due to the history of osteopenia. She was continued on Famotidine 40mg daily. Noted has previously taken Nexium. In the past had worked on diet and lifestyle modifications and weight loss to improve her symptoms (cut out Dr Pepper and fried foods etc). She has history of a lot of phlegm and mucus in her throat and was to see ENT in the past.
Reviewed outside records. She was seen at Methodist Bulverde ER 6/29/2025 diarrhea x 1 month CT scan with enterocolitis 5.9 cm left pelvic mass WBC 11.5 Was given Azithromycin. She has been having intermittent issues with hemorrhoids and rectal bleeding and has tried various OTC products without benefit.
Currently, patient reports she has been dealing with hemorrhoid issues for a few months now.  Says after the first of the year had some greasy/oily stools and thought maybe was related to holiday diet.  Says by March was eating better and walking and increasing physical actiivity but in mid-april or beginning of May started having diarrhea. Then June 29th ended up in the ER and was diagnosed with colitis.  Was treated with abx and her diarrhea stopped and bowels went back to normal. But still had a lot of hemorrhoid irritation with burning and blood on tissue with wiping.  Symptoms worse with walking exercise and having worse bleeding.  She started to wonder if maybe she has anal fissure rather than hemorrhoid since usually her hemorrhoids eventually go away.  Has tried various OTC products without much benefit.  Says is having issue with pieces of stool getting stuck in the rectum and having to wipe several times with wet toilet paper and then sits in the tub. Having about 3 bowel movements per day and are rough and dry. Says it feels like a papercut at her rectum after bowel movements.  Is not on fiber supplement or Miralax.

Abdominal pain, bloating
History of Present Illness:
Daniel is a pleasant 56-year-old male who presents for evaluation of abdominal pain and bloating. His history includes tirzepatide and metformin but discontinued use of these around 3 months ago. He stopped these medications as he felt these led to his symptoms. He is complaining of a ""stitch"" on his right upper quadrant. He describes this as similar to an exercise cramp but it is constantly there. He denies aggravators or alleviators. He is reporting constant abdominal bloating. He typically has regular bowel movements but when eating poorly his stools will become loose. Denies melena or hematochezia. He notes chronic acid reflux and uses Pepcid or Tums as needed. Again his heartburn is present when his diet is poor. Denies dysphagia, nausea or vomiting. He does consume 3 Cokes per day, admits to moderate sugar and carbohydrate intake without much fiber or protein. He is aware about his dietary choices are likely contributing to his symptoms. He comes with a normal CBC and a GI Map performed by SALT Health and has an appointment with them later this week to discuss results. Stool test was performed back in June when he was having diarrhea. At that time he was positive for Campylobacter and Shiga like toxin E. coli with elevated commensal bacteria and opportunistic microbes. He had a normal elastase and antigliadin IgAwith a fecal calprotectin of 167. His most recent colonoscopy in 2019 with removal of 1 sigmoid tubular adenoma.

Bloating (abdominal)
Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea
Assessment:
He presents for evaluation of abdominal pain and bloating. He has not had any workup for his symptoms other than his GI Map. This suggests bacterial overgrowth and his symptoms are consistent with IBS-D so we will have him complete a course of Xifaxan. He is aware that his diet is not the best and he consumes highly fermentable items, strongly encouraged low FODMAP including eliminating his soda intake. He is due for colonoscopy due to his history of adenomatous colon polyps we will get him scheduled for that. He also has chronic acid reflux now with right upper quadrant pain so we will schedule EGD to rule out evidence of peptic ulcer disease, H. pylori, celiac disease, Barrett's or other pathology. We will obtain liver enzymes on him today and get him scheduled for ultrasound for hepatobiliary assessment.Further recommendations will be given post.

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 50-year-old female who presents for a follow-up visit for abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits for years. Patient was last seen on 7/2/2025 for a CSP as noted below. She reports that when she eats trigger foods, she will have diarrhea and abdominal pain, although she has not figured out what certain foods are causing her symptoms. She states that she is very concerned as that seems to be her new norm. She has 1-2 BM once daily fluctuating all over bristol stool scale. She had this episode yesterday.
24 hour diet recall: salad (greens, cucumbers, fresh tuna, vinaigrette), fried rice, chicken, water, sparkling water soda, coffee, no breakfast. She takes women's vitamins, and biotin.

Family history of colon cancer in mother
Assessment:
1. IBS-D: We discussed the pathophysiology and natural history of irritable bowel syndrome. We discussed the ROME IV criteria which the patient meets; I suspect IBS-D pre-dominant disease. We discussed the implications of diet, the brain-gut interaction/visceral hypersensitivity, and dysbiosis on the manifestation of symptoms and guiding treatment options. Other considerations include SIBO/IMO and functional bowel disorders which can have a similar presentation. Will plan to optimize the patient's bowel regimen with anti-spasmodics, IBGard and dicyclomine, as needed for abdominal pain. I have also provided information on a low FODMAP diet which has been studied in patients with IBS. Will plan to obtain a H.pylori, SIBO breath test, TSH and celiac panel with consideration for further testing including colonoscopy and breath testing based on symptoms/response to treatment. We discussed the role of neuromodulators (ie. TCA v. SSRI) as well which we can be considered in the future. Will provide a course of Xifaxan to start after SIBO testing performed since she is going to Morocco in October for vacation and is very worried that she won't be able to enjoy due to her GI sx.
Plan:
Low FODMAP diet basic, patient education materials generated by EMR
Gradual titration of fiber supplementation discussed (Citrucel 1-2 tabs/daily.)
H. pylori, Urea Breath Test (UBT)
Celiac Ab profile: tTg IgG/IgA, DGP IgG/IgA, total IgA
TSH with reflex to T4

abdominal pain
History of Present Illness:
Jennifer Sanchez is a 49 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit.
This is a patient we see for IBS. Last seen April 2024 by Dr. McMyler.
Has IBS and chronic abdominal pain. Fructose and lactose malabsorption test were negative. Colonoscopy was essentially normal in 2019. KUB 2019 revealed moderate colonic stool burden. She reported in May 2023 started daily exercising and intermittent fasting. Noted the exercise did help with the pain and she would pass gas when she was walking. She did try MiraLAX and had soft stools but she is unsure if she took it long enough. States when she passes the stool then she has increased abdominal pain. Once the stools pass her pain does improve. Peppermint oil does aid with her symptoms and uses it topically. Has previously been prescribed a trial of duloxetine 30 mg once a day but patient never tried it states she has been exercising and taking magnesium 500 mg 1-2 tabs a day and having a bowel movement once a day. Still has pain and bloating but it has improved and usually worsens around her cycle.
Currently, patient reports that she has a pain in the LUQ and thought maybe she strained a muscle with working out.  Started a couple weeks ago.  Went to urgent care on Friday and had an abdominal xray and was told it was normal.  Says the pain is sharp and worse with movement such as twisting or bending.   The pain does improve with Advil.  Has been alternating ice and heating pad as well. No shingles rash.  Has tried to modify her kettle bell swings. Pain does not worsen with deep inspiration. Says the past year has been crazy with her IBS and having some increased gas pain and has more pain with fluctuation of her hormones.  Is having a  BM once a day.  But has a lot of bloating and does sleep with a heating pad.   No nausea or vomiting.  Is having a lot of heartburn and belching recently but not taking anything for this.

Bloating, constipation with straining, blood in stool
History of Present Illness:
Dear Dr. Mistry, I had the wonderful pleasure of meeting Brenda today who as you know is a 34yo WF who is being referred for evaluation and management of ~20 year history of gradual onset, progressively worsening bloating mainly evening to morning with no Sx lunch to evening interestingly when she eats her biggest meals accompanied by lower abdominal cramping pain and separate constipation which she feels is not linked without any apparent complications in the setting of comorbidities including anxiety/depression on SSRI and obesity and FHx notable for pancreatic cancer (M, AC, Stage 4, passed away 58yo). She was told bloating was due to previous ovarian cyst rupture but unclear. There appears to be no link with sick contact, foreign travel, specific medication use, specific food intake, positional changes, bowel movements, stress or time of day and has not identified any clear precipitants or any alleviating or exacerbating features. She had HP breath test in 1/23 negative.  Patient has not had any other GI/PHB specific diagnostic w/u. She is on probiotics and has been on Miralax. Patient has not used any other Rx/OTC/CAM GI/PHB meds. Patient eats a balanced, healthy diet with one meal a day at lunch and notes no nutrient/element/mineral/vitamin deficiency or any food intolerances/allergies. She has tried fibers and avoided lactose/gluten. No other dietary changes were made. Patient denies any other upper/fore-to-midgut GI symptoms including upper abdominal pain, heartburn/pyrosis, indigestion, nausea, vomiting/emesis, coffee ground bleeding, hematemesis, globus sensation, dysphagia, odynophagia, chest pain, regurgitation, hiccups/singultus, excessive burping/eructation, early satiety, decreased appetite or any respiratory/ENT symptoms. Patient denies any other lower/mid-to-hindgut GI symptoms including anorectal pain/itching, incontinence, diarrhea, excessive flatulence, abnormal stool contents, hemorrhoids, fissures, fistulas, skin tags or hernias. Patient denies any hepatobiliary symptoms including jaundice, icterus, dark urine, clay stools, pruritus, easy bruising/bleeding, abdominal/leg swelling, rash or confusion. Patient denies any systemic symptoms including weight loss, fatigue, fevers, chills or night sweats. Below you will find my impression and plan as requested. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to participate in the care of your referred patient. Please contact me directly on my cell (214-908-4292) anytime if you have any questions. In good health, Alexander Mantas, MD.

This is been escalating in intensity for the last 3 months. 2 months ago he was diagnosed with H. pylori and treated with amoxicillin, clarithromycin and PPI therapy. He did not feel like the antibiotics was beneficial and there was no follow-up breath test to evaluate for for eradication. He states that the pain is a pressure-like pain which is constant, worsening after eating with associated nausea. No overt GI bleeding, melena, hematochezia. An emergency room visit where an ultrasound revealed a normal-appearing gallbladder without stones.

Diarrhea
History of Present Illness:
Henry Ellis is a 47 year old male who is seen today for a first visit.
47-year-old male presents with chronic intermittent diarrhea, excessive flatulence, and mild fecal incontinence for approximately 18 months, which began after a severe bout of diarrhea (20 episodes in 48 hours) during a 4-week trip to South America. Patient reports episodic symptoms occurring approximately once weekly, characterized by a day of severe gas, bloating, and aggressive flatulence that is occasionally accompanied by small amounts of fecal leakage. He describes having to urgently go to the bathroom up to a dozen times daily due to fear of incontinence. Two weeks ago, he experienced an acute flare with 20 cases of diarrhea in a 48-hour period. This morning, he reports using the toilet four times before his appointment and noted some blood in his stool, which he attributes to rectal irritation from frequent bowel movements rather than frank blood.
Previous treatments have included a 7-day course of Levaquin and a 7-day course of Flagyl, neither of which resolved his symptoms. Patient has also attempted dietary modifications including gluten-free and lactose-free diets without improvement. He tried probiotics for three months from a specific manufacturer but did not notice any significant benefit. He has also been using a nutritional shake recently in an attempt to settle his symptoms. He has not tried any gas-reducing medications (gasx).
Patient reports an increase in appetite over and has experienced weight gain rather than loss. He continues to take Pantoprazole daily for management of GERD associated with a hiatal hernia, which was diagnosed in 2019 along with an esophageal ring that required dilation. He reports no current swallowing difficulties since the dilation procedure.
Recent labs show mildly elevated ALT (74) and cholesterol. Patient consumes approximately one alcoholic drink daily, sometimes more.

Diagnosis:
Abdominal pain, generalized (c)
Nausea alone
Assessment:
15 yo female with a hx of cholecystectomy 2 years ago 2/2 biliary dyskinesia Since her GB was taken out abdominal pain, nausea worse with eatng but can happen independent of eating too, flushing, early satiety, belching and headaches and fatige are also problems for her but seem more independent of eating. Admits to worries as well. Weight gain after pubery.
Hard to put all this together, is this functional dyspepsia with other autonomic symptoms or is this disease. Will look around. Other things to maybe consider here would be a mast cell issues, pain bounces around so disease sounds less likely. Would PCOS be something to consider.
9/11/25:  Sx the same --> will go with amitritpyline
Plan:
amitriptyline 10 mg take 1 tablet each night for 1 week, then increase by 1 tablet a week to a max of 3 tablets a night
Additional Notes:
- for esopghagitis and gastritis that was MINIMAL , mom has already put her on Nexium in the past with no changes, dont feel the need to push acid supression more then
- Trail Amitriptyline for functional dyspepsia 10 mg --> 30
- told mom about side effects
- I like the idea of endocrinology to check that box
- have spoke about gluten sensitivity ?
- healthy eating - no fast food, baked, not fried,
- more water less sugar bevs
- FD gard in the mean time if she feels it helps"

bloating, altered bowel habits, diarrhea
History of Present Illness:
This is a 62-year-old female patient here to see me for chronic abdominal bloating and pain, which has been ongoing since 2012.
The patient reports significant abdominal bloating and pain, localized to the lower abdomen. These symptoms have been persistent since 2012. She denies any specific upper gastrointestinal symptoms such as heartburn, reflux, nausea, vomiting, or dysphagia. There is no mention of a change in bowel habits, constipation, diarrhea, blood in the stool, or rectal bleeding. She has had multiple emergency department visits for these symptoms, where investigations including abdominal X-rays and endoscopy were reportedly normal.
The only medication mentioned is metformin, which she has been taking for years. The onset of her symptoms does not correlate with the initiation of this medication.
Her pertinent past surgical history includes an intestinal perforation in 2012, which she believes was secondary to diverticulitis. This was initially managed medically without success, leading to a partial intestinal resection and a temporary colostomy for 6 months, after which she underwent a reversal procedure. Her chronic symptoms began after these surgical interventions. She had an upper endoscopy and colonoscopy approximately 5 years ago, which were normal. She has a family history of stomach cancer in a sister.

Diagnoses:
Bloating (abdominal)
Altered bowel habits
Diarrhea (c)
Assessment:
1. Chronic abdominal pain, diarrhea and bloating: The symptoms are most likely secondary to post-surgical adhesions. The history of intestinal perforation, peritonitis, and subsequent surgeries (colostomy and reversal) has likely resulted in scar tissue formation. This scar tissue can restrict the normal movement and distension of the bowel, leading to pain when gas is present, as it stretches the bowel wall and the surrounding adhesions. Other potential causes for her symptoms are being considered, including small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), which can occur in the setting of altered bowel motility and anatomy post-surgically. While less likely given her previous negative evaluations, inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease will also be formally ruled out via laboratory testing. Malignancy is very low on the differential given her normal imaging and endoscopic procedures, including a normal EGD and colonoscopy 5 years ago.
Plan:
- To investigate for SIBO, a breath test kit will be sent to the patient's home for completion.
- Labs ordered as below. The labs will assess for systemic inflammation and celiac disease.
- Follow-up will be scheduled to discuss the results of the breath test and laboratory studies to guide further management.
The patient has verbally consented to the use of a virtual scribe.

Additional Notes:
After Visit Summary:
- Your visit today was for long-term abdominal bloating and pain. We discussed that these symptoms are likely related to scar tissue from your past surgeries in 2012.
- We will do some further testing to look for other possible causes. We will be checking some blood work today. We are also sending a breath test kit to your home to check for a condition called small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).
- Please complete the blood tests today. The lab is here in the building. You do not need to be fasting for these tests.
- For the breath test, the kit will be mailed to you. Instructions are included. After you complete the test, you will mail it back using the provided FedEx packaging.
- We will see you back in the office to review all the results and create a treatment plan.
- Do not start taking any probiotics until after you have completed the breath test."

History of Present Illness:
Camille Babin is a 55 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit. Here today to discuss scheduling EGD/colonoscopy. Last seen here 2019. She had an EGD at that time and was lost to follow up. Biopsies then revealed eactive gastropathy, possible barretts. Her mother died of esophageal cancer (38). Her father died from complications from pancreatitis (60). She has history of gastric band. She has a lot of heartburn and takes a lot of Tums (2-4 at a time) a few times a week. She feels like her heartburn has been more progressive. She feels it is hard to swallow if she has heartburn but denies dysphagia with liquids or solids. She is not a smoker.
No prior colonoscopy. Denies family history of colon cancer or colon polyps. She has loose stool which is her baseline bowel pattern since her gallbladder was removed. She does not take anything for this. She rarely has constipation. She does notice bleeding both with wiping and has seen streaked on her stool. This is bright red and not daily or progressive. This does spontaneously resolve without treatment. She has no abdominal pain or rectal pain. Her weight is stable with no unintentional weight loss.

Chronic idiopathic constipation
Personal history of colonic polyps
Assessment:
1. Moderate Gastroparesis
- Assessment: Delayed gastric emptying confirmed on scintigraphy. Correlates with endoscopic findings of retained food. Symptoms include bloating and constipation.
- Medical treatment planned: Discussed Reglan (metoclopramide) for acute symptom flares. To be used PRN. No daily medication planned now.
- Lifestyle modifications: Continue with dietary changes. Eat lighter diet if symptoms flare. Eat evening meal earlier. Adjust Miralax dose as needed to maintain regular BMs without diarrhea. Can use half-doses.
- Investigations planned: Discussed potential future interventions if symptoms worsen: EGD with Botox injection to pylorus, or surgical myotomy.
- Follow-up appointments: F/U in 1 year. To return sooner if symptoms progress.
2. Altered Bowel Habits (Constipation/Diarrhea)
- Assessment: Likely related to underlying dysmotility/gastroparesis.
- Medical treatment planned: Continue Miralax, titrating dose to effect. Discussed prescription medications for constipation if it worsens, but will remain conservative for now.
Additional Notes:
- Patient education on gastroparesis provided. Visited recommended educational website.
- Instructions for symptom monitoring: Advised to seek care if symptoms progress. Advised to de-escalate diet (e.g., liquids, low-fiber) during flares.
- Addressed concern regarding next colonoscopy. Recommended in 5 years, health permitting, per Dr. Fajardo's letter. Will re-evaluate need closer to the time.

Paulette Griffin is a 50 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit. Last seen in June 2025. She lost response to Lubiprostone 24mcg BID. She was given Linzess 145mcg samples on 8/29. She has a bowel movement 2-3 times since 8/29. She reports her insurance did not cover Linzess or Trulance and only covered Lactulose. When attempting to send in Linzess this appears to be on formulary. She did not want to take Lactulose because this can be taken orally or rectally. She is taking Hydrocodone three times daily for back pain. She used to take Movantik but this was costly. She has failed MiraLAX. She does get relief with milk of magnesia and liquid Dulcolax. She has associated lower abdominal cramping and bloating that is relieved with defecation. She is taking opioids three times per day for back pain. She denies overt GI bleeding and diarrhea. Colonoscopy February 2025 with 11+ polyps removed that were TA or HP. Ambry Genetic testing was negative. She is due for repeat colonoscopy in February 2026. She denies dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, GERD symptoms, and lower abdominal pain. She remains on Omeprazole 40mg twice daily. EGD 2024.

I last saw patient due to diarrhea, stool studies at that time revealed and elevated fecal cal pro and a CDIFF + PCR, toxin negative. We increased her Budesonide to 3x daily at that time until stool studies came back. She subsequently developed acute abdominal pain after she was seen and presented to the ER.

History of Present Illness:
Donna Patrick is a 78 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit. Patient is here for follow-up after having an upper GI endoscopy done. This was done for her complaints of dysphagia and underlying hiatal hernia. On EGD she was found to have a 6 cm hiatal hernia and dilatation of the distal esophagus/stricture was done. She feels that her swallowing has improved but is extremely concerned about her having fundic land polyps and states has been laying off of PPI. She has stopped PPI in the past also.
In terms of her constipation she states that she was unable to get lubiprostone from a Walmart pharmacy because of the cost. She has been taking magnesium with improvement of her symptoms.
She also has a known history of a pancreatic cyst which has been stable. Repeat MRI is pending in December but she is not sure if she wants to do this as she feels that she may not want to do surgery in future for the pancreatic cyst, if needed
8/8/25
Donna Patrick is a 78 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit. Patient here for GI consultation for complaints of having difficulty with swallowing. Patient states that sometimes she feels that the food gets stuck in the retrosternal area and sometimes she points to her lower sternum. On questioning she states this happens with both solids and liquids. Patient has known history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and a hiatal hernia and has been taking rabeprazole every day. On her last endoscopy she was found to have a 5 cm hiatal hernia and was suspected to have significant esophageal dysmotility. Patient denies any weight loss at this point.
She also states that her constipation has not improved but she still continues to struggle. She does use MiraLAX but finds it hard as she is to mix it with water or drink. She has been taking stool softeners every day without relief. She has known underlying constipation predominant IBS.
Patient also underwent an MRI of her pancreatic cyst repeat MRI shows a stable cyst in the neck of the pancreas measuring 1.1 cm x 0.5 cm. Findings are consistent with a sidebranch IPMN. Main pancreatic duct was normal. CBD was reported 10 mm but patient is status postcholecystectomy.
10/16/24
Donna Patrick is a 77 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit. Patient is here for a GI clinic visit as she had undergone a CT of the abdomen pelvis for renal stones on which she was found to have possibly a cyst in the pancreas. She subsequently underwent an MRI of the pancreas on which she was found to have 2 separate cysts. The largest cyst was measuring up to 1.5 cm x 7mm with mild lobulation and possibly an internal septation. No mural nodule was seen. No complication was seen with the pancreatic duct. The main pancreatic duct itself was not dilated. Another small 6 mm x 4mm cyst was seen inferior to the pancreatic head which possibly is communicating with the main pancreatic duct. On questioning patient does not have any epigastric pain at this point. There are no pancreatic symptoms. No prior known history of pancreatitis. Interestingly her CT done in 2022 had not reported any cyst in the pancreas.
Patient has known history of chronic heartburn for which she takes rabeprazole. Her main issue seems to be related to her having a lot of gas. Patient states that she has been working to lose weight and has lost over 20 pounds in the last 1 year. She has been eating very healthy.
She is known to have history of chronic right lower quadrant pain. A colonoscopy done in 2021 did not show any evidence of ileitis or colitis. CAT scans and never shown any evidence of right lower quadrant disease.:

Donna Patrick  is a 76 year old   female  who is seen today for a follow-up visit. Patient is here for a clinic follow-up and has multitude of complaints which she says that she has been having a lot of belching and feels very gassy, has been having a lot of flatulence. Patient is known to have history of gastroesophageal reflux and a hiatal hernia, is drinking carbonated water weight in front of me. States that she does need to drink carbonated water so that she is able to burp out her excessive gas. Patient has been taking omeprazole 20 mg every day. Patient for her abdominal bloating was told to go use a low FODMAP diet, but now blames the diet for her 20 pound weight gain. She is a history of chronic right lower quadrant pain which is some correlation with constipation. Patient states that when she uses MiraLAX she feels better with pain, though uses MiraLAX only one she is severely constipated which leads to subsequent diarrhea.
11/9/22
Donna Patrick  is a 75 year old   female  who is seen today for a follow-up visit.Patient had been seen around one year ago.  She continues to have chronic right hip pain which she feels also sometimes in the front. Patient had undergone a CT in June 2022, ordered by Urology.  This was a noncontrast CT.  No significant changes were seen as compared to her CT done late last year.  She does have underlying hiatal hernia and colonic diverticulosis.A colonoscopy done last year had shown diverticular disease without any strictures.
Patient states today that pantoprazole is not strong enough for her and she continues to reflux symptoms.  Other options were PPS were given and she states she has used them all.  It seems that she continues to drink at least 3-4 cups of caffeine every day and states she likes doing that and would like to continue with that.  Patient also likely has constipation predominant IBS and could not afford Linzess.  I had recommended her to use MiraLAX on a routine basis which she has not done so far.  She said she takes Colace, seems reluctant to use MiraLAX regularly.
11/17/21
Donna Patrick  is a 74 year old   female  who is seen today for a follow-up visit.Patient says that she recently was diagnosed to have osteoporosis and does not want to take biphosphonate's because of for GI issues.  She says she has been trying to take calcium and feels constipated and stopped doing it.  Patient did not use Linzess as says he did not want to get diarrhea and this was expensive.  Her heartburn symptoms are well controlled with use of PPI but now she is concerned with further use because of her osteoporosis.  On questioning she does still get some pain in the right lower abdomen.  She still has underlying constipation and bloating. 10/16/24

Burping
Dysphagia
GERD
Hiatal hernia
Assessment:
Dysphagia: I suspect patient's dysphagia is most likely due to esophageal dysmotility s/p  EGD with dilatation.Patient did feel improvement of her symptoms after dilatation. In terms of her esophageal dysmotility
I did discuss with her about making dietary changes and especially avoiding ice cold drinks or hot beverages, Patient should stay on PPI BID
Specially considering her large hiatal hernia and esophageal stricture formation.
I did explain that fundic gland polyps do not have any cancer potential even with use of PPI
Pancreatic cyst:
Patient was found to have 2 separate cysts in the area of the pancreatic head On a prior MRI. Repeat MRI done now shows 1 cystic lesion in the area of the pancreatic neck measuring 1.1cm x 0.5 cm. Pancreatic duct is normal.. It is possible that this/these may be IPMNs, no prior episodes of pancreatitis in the last few years. Clinically she is asymptomatic. Considering incidental finding of cysts, possibly needs ongoing surveillance with MRIs in Dec this year
Gastroesophageal reflux disease:. She has underlying 6 cm hiatal hernia. In the past
I have given her the option for surgery for hernia repair and antireflux surgery, reluctant though wants to talk to surgery
Patientrecommended to continue on PPI and split dosing
Bloating: Advised patient to use probiotics on a regular basis, can consider use of Beano. Avoidance of fermentable foods is most to limit gas formation, patient blames a low FODMAP diet for weight gain.
Irritable bowel syndrome: Constipation predominant, Still continues to be symptomatic. I will try to send  lubiprostone to mark cuban's pharmacy
Plan:
Refer to Dr. Muhammad Umar Butt
MRI Abdomen WITH and WITHOUT contrast - 74183   dec 2025
Adhere to lifestyle and dietary modifications for GERD diet as we discussed. This includes avoiding fatty and greasy foods, fried foods, tomato based foods, caffeine, carbonated drinks, coffee and alcohol. Elevate the head of your bed 6 inches. Additionally, do not eat or drink anything including water within two hours of going to bed at night or 10pm, whichever comes first. Recommend low fat, low cholesterol diet and exercise.

GERD, atypical chest pain
History of Present Illness:
This is a 34-year-old patient here to see me for worsening symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease. He has a history of reflux for over eight years, with a prior upper endoscopy in 2018. He has been on pantoprazole 40 mg daily for approximately five years but reports his symptoms have been worsening despite this medication. His primary care provider recently prescribed esomeprazole, which he has not yet started.
He reports daily symptoms of constant burping and regurgitation of food particles, which he has to spit out. He denies any blood in the regurgitated material. Symptoms occur throughout the day and are not limited to specific times. He notes that even if he misses a meal, such as lunch, he will experience acid reflux symptoms despite having taken his pantoprazole in the morning. He denies any dysphagia or issues with swallowing. He does not experience nocturnal reflux symptoms that wake him from sleep. He reports experiencing intermittent, sharp, atypical chest pains, which he has had in the past and were evaluated by a cardiologist who attributed them to reflux. He also describes a sensation of bloating after taking his medication, which lasts for a while before fading. He reports that his gastrointestinal symptoms can trigger his anxiety, and vice-versa, creating a cycle.
He has been on pantoprazole 40 mg daily for about five years. His provider recently prescribed esomeprazole. He has previously tried a combination of pantoprazole 20 mg and famotidine, which provided no relief.
Past medical history is significant for gastroesophageal reflux disease and anxiety. He underwent an upper endoscopy in approximately 2018 due to reflux. He denies any complications from prior endoscopy or anesthesia. He has no known cardiac or pulmonary history other than the atypical chest pain evaluated and deemed non-cardiac.
He has made significant dietary modifications since the beginning of the year, reducing consumption of greasy foods and eating out only once a week instead of frequently. This has contributed to a weight loss from 300 lbs at the beginning of the year to a current weight of 273 lbs. He denies any family history of similar gastrointestinal problems. He does not smoke or use illicit drugs. Alcohol use was not discussed.

Diagnoses:
GERD without esophagitis (e)
Atypical chest pain
Assessment:
1. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): Symptoms are significant and refractory to a 5-year course of pantoprazole 40 mg daily. He experiences daily regurgitation, burping, and atypical chest pain despite medication. His symptoms have persisted despite positive lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes and weight loss. The chronicity of his symptoms (8+ years) and inadequate response to a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) warrant further investigation. The plan is to repeat an upper endoscopy to evaluate for chronic changes such as a hiatal hernia, a lax lower esophageal sphincter, or Barrett's esophagus, and to rule out other pathology. The possibility of future surgical intervention, such as a LINX procedure or hiatal hernia repair, was discussed as a long-term management option if medical therapy remains suboptimal, given his young age.
Plan:
- An upper endoscopy (EGD) is planned to evaluate the esophagus and stomach. We will take biopsies to rule out infectious etiologies and evaluate for chronic changes.
- The risks and benefits, preparation, and procedural details were discussed and any questions were answered.
- The patient will stop taking pantoprazole and start esomeprazole as prescribed by his primary care provider.
- Follow-up will be scheduled after the procedure to discuss the findings and adjust the management plan accordingly.
The patient has verbally consented to the use of a virtual scribe.
Plan:
EGD with Anesthesia Provider/CRNA who is hereby directed and authorized to administer anesthesia - 43235
Risks and benefits statement: The procedure and its preparation, benefits, alternatives, and limitations were explained to the patient or legal guardian. The risks and potential complications including but not limited to perforation, bleeding, infection, missed lesion, aspiration and other complications of sedation were reviewed. The patient or legal guardian verbalized understanding and wishes to proceed.
Additional Notes:
After Visit Summary:
- Your visit today was for long-term acid reflux that is not getting better with your current medication, pantoprazole. Your symptoms include daily burping, food coming back up, and chest pain.
- We discussed that your symptoms are significant enough that we need to take a closer look with a camera test called an upper endoscopy (EGD). This will help us see if there is any damage to your esophagus from the acid or if there is another reason for your symptoms, like a hernia. We also discussed that depending on the findings, surgery might be an option in the future to provide a more permanent solution for your reflux.
- You should stop taking the pantoprazole.
- You should start taking the new medicine your doctor prescribed, esomeprazole. Please call your pharmacy to have it filled.
- We will schedule the EGD procedure. You will be able to pick a date that works for you. You will need someone to drive you home on the day of the procedure."

dysphagia, screening for colon cancer
History of Present Illness:
This is a 62-year-old female patient of Dr. Coxsey with GERD previously under the care of Dr. Vallera and last seen by him on 12/1/22; she had a barium esophagogram around that time that was unremarkable. She has had similar complaints for 5-6 years. This does not effect her swallowing. She has this feeling all of the time. She has occasional reflux. She does not take any medications for acid reflux. She denies stress or anxiety. She had surgery on her vocal cords when she was a child.
She has a remote history of H pylori status post treatment.
EGD, 11/3/2021, Normal mucosa in the middle third of the esophagus. (Biopsy), Irregular margins in the gastroesophageal junction compatible with changes of chronic esophagitis and Erythema in the antrum and stomach body compatible with gastritis. (Biopsy, Biopsy). Mid esophageal biopsies normal. Gastric biopsies showed a mild chronic gastritis; H pylori negative. There was also focal intestinal metaplasia.
CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis 11/5/21 as follow-up to an abnormal ultrasound and MRI showed scattered hepatic angiomyolipomas. The bowel was described as normal.
She has not had a prior colonoscopy. Cologuard 11/19/21 was negative.

Follow-up from recurrent admissions for anemia and GI bleeding
History of Present Illness:
-81-year-old who was transferred from an outside facility for anemia and black and tarry stools. I originally did the endoscopy and found he had several AVMs 1 in the stomach and 1 in the small bowel that I treated with APC. He responded to blood and iron and was eventually discharged. Within a week or 2 he presented back with symptomatic anemia with again drop in his hemoglobin and the passage of black stool. He was transferred back to Harris Southwest where one of my partners did a second endoscopy and retreated several AVMs. Since that time he has done well with only really 1 bowel movement since his discharge. He did see hematology who is planning on giving him iron transfusions. He also saw cardiology who thinks he may or may not need cardiac stents and/or other revascularization procedures plus he also might be a good candidate for a Watchman procedure which would allow him to get off of the Eliquis.

Assessment:
-This is almost certainly a result of AVMs complicated by him starting Eliquis for his A-fib. Unfortunately his stroke risk is high enough that coming off the Eliquis is not a good option but he may be a candidate for the watchman. We have performed 2 endoscopies where several AVMs have been cauterized but I suspect that he has multiple more distal in his small bowel that have been bleeding resulting in his anemia and admissions. We need to do a capsule endoscopy to document that there is no other bleeding source in his GI tract as well as to document the presence of AVMs if they are there. He is not a good candidate for anything other than emergent endoscopy given his suspected coronary artery disease and thus would not recommend doing a colonoscopy at this time.
Plan:
Small bowel capsule endoscopy - 91110 Please give 1/2 dose of the miralax gatorade prep prior to the capsule study.

Stomach / Abdominal Pain and Burning, Constipation
History of Present Illness:
4/30/24: 69 yo M here for consultation regarding ongoing dysphagia. Father had throat cancer. Has sensation of fullness in his throat started feeling this he believes 6-12 months. Does have heartburn takes omeprazole for this and seems to control. Has also had chronic pain follows with pain specialist. Has not had egd or colonoscopy had cologuard last year and thinks may have been positive but he attributed to swallowing blood from his dental procedure. Has CHF and follows with cardiologist now Dr. Levin and has done well for several years on medication for control. Had swallow study which was normal he thinks and also had laryngoscopy with ENT and was reportedly normal.
6/13/25: 70 yo M w/ PMHx of reflux here in clinic for the above. Pt was previously recommended to have a EGD/colonoscopy for screening and dysphagia however this was not done. Per chart review, pt declined to schedule on 5/14/24. Pt seen today c/o stomach issues for the past few months. Reports constant abdominal pain/discomfort, worse when hungry, rated 6/10. Difficulty eating/drinking due to significant bloating, adding even water causes bloating, so he sips water to keep throat moist while minimizing symptoms. Denies any associated N/V. Bloating and muscle pain worsen SOB. Poor sleep, reporting about 3 hrs/night due to pain when his pain medications wear off. Continues to have dysphagia to solids more than liquids and states tilting head helps. On omeprazole 20 mg, controls reflux w/ occasional breakthrough. Reports change in bowel habits since abd pain onset, reporting few BMs/week, Bristol 1-4. Uses stool softeners PRN w/ moderate relief and takes MOM as needed. Takes daily ibuprofen for chronic shoulder pain for several years. Multiple recent ER visits w/ last at THK ED on 6/11/25 for abdominal pain, decreased BMs, SOB, and CP. ED workup unremarkable including abdominal US (6/11/25) showed hepatic steatosis, mild GB wall thickening, no stones. CTAP w/ contrast showed pericholecystic edema, bilateral pleural effusions, hepatic steatosis. Pt was recommended to f/u w/ PCP. Denies blood thinner, tobacco, or alcohol use. Notably, pt had positive Cologuard 2 yrs ago and has not had colonoscopy to further evaluate.
9/11/25: 70 yo M w/ PMHx of reflux, fatty liver, atrial fibrillation (Afib) (cardioversion in 12/2024 and 1/2025), and stent placement in 8/2025, presents for f/u. He has had increased SOB and fluid retention over the past several weeks, leading to multiple ER visits and hospitalizations, the most recent from 9/1-9/2. He was transferred from THK for evaluation of CP. Initial workup showed no acute ischemia. His sx were likely non-cardiac and he was referred to pain management for arthritis and pain medication adjustment. He reports seeing cardiology 2 days ago and was told his heart is stable.
He now reports persistent, severe abdominal pain described as constant, sharp, and burning, often feeling like a knife cutting him. The pain worsens when hungry or after eating, leading him to avoid food. It is sometimes so severe it affects his breathing and wakes him at night. He was visibly teary during the visit, distressed by the ongoing pain. Pain medications (morphine, fentanyl, hydrocodone) have provided minimal relief, w/ hydrocodone worsening his breathing and causing hypotension. He also reports new-onset N/V starting last week, w/ episodes triggered by food smells. Bloating occurs after every meal, and he experiences pain when wearing a belt. His bowel habits alternate between constipation and regular BMs, though he sometimes goes days w/o a BM. MOM prn has been helpful, having stools that are Bristol 1-6. Additionally, the patient requires supplemental oxygen due to SOB.

Follow up
History of Present Illness:
Cecelia Brooks is a 69 year old female w/ hx/o GERD/gastric intestinal metaplasia, SIBO, adenomatous colon polyps, scleroderma esophagus, s/p Dor fundoplication and HH repair, breast cancer, Sjogren's, DM, fibromyalgia, HTN, & arthritis
She is here today for follow up.
Reports persistent Halitosis. This problem has been ongoing for years and GI workup has been largely unrevealing.. Also reports persistent issues with reflux/epigastric discomfort.  Extensive workup in our office, including EGD/Colonoscopy/labs/CT imaging have been largely unrevealing.  She was referred to BUMC for 2nd opinion.  EGD with endoflip/Bravo/esophagram  5/2025 largely unrevealing aside from evidence of possible esophageal dysmotility.  Dr. Reddy did order esophageal manometry and gastric empty study, however she has not followed up.  Denies significant dysphagia at this time. Currently takes omeprazole 40 mg once daily with daily breakthrough symptoms with acid reflux and heartburn. She has previously tried Omeprazole, Pantoprazole, Esomeprazole without relief. Voquezna was not cost effective.
H/o SIBO.  Treated with abx therapy.
.History of colon polyps. Up todate.  Colonoscopy 9/23 reviewed.  Recall colonoscopy in place for 9/2028
Prior:
- Esophagram 10/3/2024 - prior fundoplication, prominent residual contrast in distal esophagus w/ delayed clearance into stomach, tight fundoplication could be considered

- EGD 09/12/2023 - nml duodenum, mild gastritis, LA A esophagitis. Bx + for GIM, No celiac, Hpylori, or Barretts or Candida. Surveillance EGD in recall for 9/12/25.
- Colonoscopy 09/12/2023 - Grade I IH, mild diverticulosis, 5mm TA in cecum. Surveillance colonoscopy in recall for 9/12/28.
- GES 4/4/2023 - normal
- Esophageal motility 10/12/2022 - 1. LES with normal basal pressure and EGJ outflow obstruction present. 2. UES with normal pressure and intact relaxation. 3. Esophageal contractions are 100% failed. 4. Abnormal complete bolus transit. 5. Multiple rapid swallow sequence with failed contraction. 6. Rapid drink challenge with normal IRP (0.4 mmHg). These findings are consistent with absent contractility with EGJ outflow obstruction - while this manometric pattern can be due to Achalasia, patient's clinical history of fundoplication in the setting of absent peristalsis can also cause this pattern of EGJ outflow obstruction??
- pH impedance 10/12/2022 -?This data is consistent with normal acid exposure and a significant correlation between symptoms and reflux. Of note, the baseline impedance was very low likely due to poor bolus clearance of esophagus.
- 2022 Dor fundoplication

Assessment:
Cecelia Brooks is a 69 year old female w/ hx/o gastric intestinal metaplasia, adenomatous colon polyps, scleroderma esophagus, s/p Dor fundoplication and HH repair, breast cancer, GERD, Sjogren's, DM, fibromyalgia, HTN, & arthritis
She is here today for follow up.
1. Halitosis - This problem has been ongoing for years. Seen at BUMC for 2nd opinion earlier this year. No clear etiology found.
-Of note, patient also with Sjogren's and tonsil stones which could be playing a role in  dry mouth/malodorous breath.
2. SIBO
-I do not think SIBO can explain her other constellation of symptoms including halitosis, reflux, etc
-Tested positive for SIBO, treated first with Xifaxan + Neomycin then with Bactrim with no improvement in symptoms..
-Will re-check breath test to see if there is persistent SIBO
-Advised LOW FODMAP diet.  Discussed reducing processed foods, fried foods, artificial sweeteners, and incorporating food rich in probiotics
2. GERD
-She was referred to BUMC esophageal center for expert (Dr. Reddy) 2nd opinion--workup with EGD with endoflip/Bravo/esophagram  5/2025 largely unrevealing from some discordant information indicating some degree of esophageal dysmotility.   She was advised to proceed with esophageal manometry and gastric empty study, however has not follow up with this.  I advised her to proceed with this workup as ordered by Dr. Reddy.  Currently denies overt dysphagia.
-in the meantime continue omeprazole 40 mg daily re: GERD/history of gastric intestinal metaplasia

pt is here for f/u
pt went to emergency room for a flare up and states Renflexis isnt working for him
pt's mother has stated this multiple times
small intestines are inflammed
History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 26 yo male with PMH of autism who is nonverbal, Crohn’s disease with stricture here for follow up after ER visit.
The most recent visit was in the past few days, with a prior visit in August. His mother, who is his primary caregiver, accompanies him as he is nonverbal with autism.
During the most recent emergency room visit at Methodist, lab work revealed an elevated white blood cell count, but no anemia. Liver function tests, kidney function, lipase, and urinalysis were all within normal limits. An abdominal X-ray was unremarkable. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed, which demonstrated fecalization of the terminal ileum with a dilated, stool-filled appearance, suggestive of slow transit. The report also noted possible terminal ileitis, though the appendix was normal. Following the visit, he was prescribed a three-day course of prednisone and Colace. The mother reports that leading up to this visit, he was exhibiting unusual lethargy, poor oral intake, and minimal fluid consumption. When prompted to show where it hurt, he would touch his side, and his blood pressure was noted to be elevated.
There is significant concern from his mother that his current biologic therapy, Renflexis, is not effective. She reports that he did not seem to have these problems when he was on Remicade. The switch from Remicade to the biosimilar was due to a change in insurance. She is interested in exploring options to switch back to Remicade, including self-pay options.
His mother reports his bowel movements have been variable. Recently, they were loose. She has been using Miralax but has tried to administer it every other day, noticing that his stools were very small and soft, and perhaps larger when Miralax was held. He sometimes appears to be straining or unable to fully evacuate. He was previously on pantoprazole 40 mg for suspected reflux due to tugging at shirt, which was decreased to 20 mg at the mother's request as she no longer observed the chest-related behaviors. She has been giving him two 20 mg tablets recently out of concern. He has not been tugging at his shirt lately.
His weight has trended down from 320 lbs to 302 lbs today. A previous FibroScan was reassuring, showing no evidence of fatty liver or fibrosis.

Crohn's disease of both small and large intestine with fistula (c, IBD)
Constipation
Acid reflux
Fatty liver
Assessment:
1. Crohn’s disease/Constipation
- Recent episode of not eating, diffuse abdominal pain and went to ER twice for evaluation in August and in September
- CT scan done during ER visit showed fecalization of the TI with dilated stool-filled TI suggestive of slow transit and possible terminal ileitis. Normal appendix. CBC, CMP, and lipase were unremarkable. Pt was given prednisone 20 mg 3 tablets x 4d and Colace 100 mg BID x 10d but the pt did not start either medication
- Long-term therapy includes Renflexis infusions every 8 weeks, next infusion is on Saturday, 09/13/2025
- Stop Miralax and continue Renflexis infusions
- Reminded the patient's mother about the fecal calprotectin and CRP to evaluate the inflammatory status of the disease. Discussed that a colonoscopy should be considered as well since the last colonoscopy was in 2023 to evaluate disease progression.
- May consider changing therapy for Crohn's based on results of fecal calprotectin, CRP, and colonoscopy
- Start Linzess 145 mcg QD to address constipation better
2. Acid reflux
- Manages with pantoprazole 40 mg QD but patient's mother is unsure of the efficacy of the medication or if the pt is experiencing acid reflux due to his non-verbal state
- Pt would previously tug on his shirt which his mother interpreted as acid reflux
- Lifestyle and dietary modifications were reviewed, including avoiding spicy, fatty, acidic foods, caffeine, carbonation, and alcohol. Advised to elevate the head of the bed, eat smaller, more frequent meals, and avoid eating late at night (after 8 p.m.)
- Will schedule EGD with colonoscopy to assess for gastric and esophageal inflammation and if management with pantoprazole is necessary
- Advised to try pantoprazole 20 mg QD and see if the pt starts tugging on his shirt again. If he does, he may return to 40 mg dose daily
3. Fatty liver
- No evidence seen on Fibroscan in August
- Fibroscan showed F0-F1, suggesting minimal to no fibrosis., CAP value is consistent with no steatosis, S0
- Continue with lifestyle changes for fatty liver. Maintain a low-fat, low-carb diet

Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain
History of Present Illness:
Patient last seen July 10, 2025 for diffuse abdominal pain, fecal incontinence, reflux, nausea with vomiting and diarrhea. Patient had an EGD and colonoscopy showing only gastritis with benign biopsies, normal gastric bypass anatomy and a normal colonoscopy to the hepatic flexure. A Cologuard was ordered to rule out any lesions in the ascending colon and came back negative. Random biopsies were negative for microscopic colitis. She continued to have frequent bouts of nausea/vomiting and diarrhea. She is vomiting undigested food several hours after eating. Question whether she could be experiencing some gastroparesis. A gastric emptying study was ordered. As for the diarrhea stool studies were ordered to rule out infectious etiologies and EPI. She was given colestipol for suspected bile acid diarrhea. May also have SIBO or IBS-D. She was sent for anorectal manometry testing with Dr. Winston for fecal incontinence. Her PPI was switched to Voquezna for better coverage of her acid reflux symptoms. Patient has not yet had the gastric emptying study done. Stool testing came back negative for infectious etiologies. Pancreatic elastase came back at 290.
Patient was seen by Dr. Winston this afternoon he did some initial testing on her and found her to have a weak anal sphincter. She will have complete anorectal manometry testing soon. He suggested a possible spinal stimulator to help with her fecal incontinence. Patient states that she has her gastric emptying study scheduled on October 1. She says with the colestipol she is not having as much diarrhea but either her stools are very hard or there diarrhea. She has noted increased abdominal pain, cramping and gas in the last 2 weeks. She says that no matter what she eats she feels like she is ""digesting rocks."" Pain is in the upper abdomen rated up to an 8 out of 10. He will last until she is able to have a bowel movement. No fevers or chills. She notes some occasional blood in the stool when straining which she is not unusual for her. She has not had any recent abdominal imaging since May or June 2025. Patient states she was diagnosed with gastritis and she had normal labs. A total of 12 minutes were spent with the patient over the phone while provider present in the satellite office. No internet access available.

Patient did see colorectal surgery this morning and is going to undergo formal anorectal manometry testing. She states that Dr. Winston suggested a possible spinal stimulator. She has a gastric emptying study pending for October 1. In the meantime continue with small frequent meals and use ondansetron as needed. Nausea and vomiting has not been as often as it was previously. Encouraged her to take the ondansetron scheduled if needed. She notes less diarrhea with the colestipol but states that she has noted more constipation and hard stools alternating with diarrhea since starting it. Encouraged her to decrease the dose of the colestipol to 1 tablet twice a day or 1 tablet daily to help lessen the constipation. Will send her for CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast, repeat labs to check for any acute changes. Patient was advised over the weekend to go to the ER if her symptoms worsened. She verbalized understanding. Continue dicyclomine as needed for pain. See full plan below.

GI bleed follow up/ ERCP follow up
History of Present Illness:
Joseph Hooter is a 63 year old male who is seen today for a follow-up visit. He was recently hospitalized for acute blood loss anemia and underwent bidirectional endoscopy with no obvious etiology. Potential causes included diverticular hemorrhage as he did experience fairly copious bleeding in the days preceding this. He did receive transfusion and iron infusion thereafter and blood count is normalized. There were no other culprit abnormalities. He has undergone ERCP as well with stent removal and has no indwelling stents at this time. Hepatic enzymes are normal. He has no abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. He reports occasional difficulty swallowing, but mucosal examination recently was normal and he feels that this may have been in part related to previous chemotherapy administration.
He was diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in 2021 and underwent Whipple procedure 9/29/2021. Liver biopsy obtained at the time of surgery revealed moderate microvascular and macrovascular steatohepatitis with stage 3 fibrosis. Post operatively he underwent 12 cycles of chemotherapy planned every 2 weeks, which he finished in April 2022. During chemotherapy he had an increase in liver enzymes which were thought to be attributed to chemotherapy. Liver enzymes were elevated in cholestatic pattern and he was ultimately started on ursodiol 250 mg BID with consistent downtrend in ALP. Most recent ALP in December 2023 - 194. Most recent imaging was performed with oncologist and included MRI 2023, results are unavailable however imaging was reportedly unremarkable. Labs December 2023: Normal creatinine/GFR, bili 0.7, alk phos 194, AST 45, ALT 50, hemoglobin 12.7, hematocrit 37.6, platelets 111, AFP 2.7
EGD 2017: Probable mild peptic esophagitis status post biopsy. Otherwise widely patent esophagus: Distal esophageal biopsy showed eosinophilic count up to 25 per high-power field with mid esophageal biopsies notable for 0-2 eosinophils. Gastric biopsy showed focal complete intestinal metaplasia
Colonoscopy 2017: Normal
Fibroscan 2017: Severe hepatic steatosis and mild fibrosis, F1 to F2
CT scan 2016: Hepatic steatosis
Abdominal ultrasound 2016, hepatic steatosis
FibroScan 2019: 358/10.9
Endoscopic ultrasound 2021: Pancreatic head mass lesion with both micro and macrocystic components however ill-defined status post FNB x2 with associated pancreatic parenchymal and ductal changes as noted in celiac axis lymph nodes SP FNB x1. Cysts overall given enhancing component on MRI, mild dilation of the pancreatic duct up to 5 mm at the head of the pancreas and slight elevation in CA 19-9, underlying pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma suspected. However given micro and macrocystic components serous adenoma IV in is also on the differential.
A. Pancreatic head lesion, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration: Atypical cells present at least high-grade dysplasia
B. Celiac axis lymph node, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration: Scant benign mucosal cellular elements present. No specific lymphocyte population identified. Negative for malignant cells.
EGD 2023: Erythema in the antrum and stomach body compatible with gastritis. (Biopsy).
Post Whipple anatomy intact. Widely patent gastroenteric anastomosis. Moderate bile reflux present with associated gastropathy, for which biopsies were obtained.
Furrows in the lower third of the esophagus and middle third of the esophagus. (Biopsy).
No evidence of esophageal varices or gastric varices.

MRI abdomen 4/2024-cirrhotic liver morphology, heterogeneity involving the right lobe of the liver suggesting regenerative nodules without overt mass, features of chronic cholangiohepatitis in the setting of biliary enteric diversion, postsurgical changes of Whipple procedure, no significant short-term interval change in extrahepatic and intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation, likely related to reservoir effect
MRCP 5/2024-
1. Biliary dilatation slightly increased compared to 4/3/2024 with no visible obstructing mass. While this could be progressive reservoir effect, findings are concerning for stenosis or occult mass at the choledochojejunal anastomosis.
2. Splenomegaly slightly increased.
3. Hepatic steatosis.
ERCP 6/2024-
- widely patent pancreaticojejunostomy orifice
- stenotic/pinhole choledochojejunostomy s/p ERCP, cholangiogram with severe choledochojejunostomy stricture with upstream dilation of the intra and extrahepatic biliary tree to 10 mm s/p 2 cm x 4 mm HurriCaine balloon dilation, balloon sweep of small black pigment stones and placement of 10 mm x 40 mm fully covered metal stent with proximal end of the stent 1 cm below the confluence of right and left hepatic ducts.

Biliary stricture/obstruction (e)
Cirrhosis
History of coronary artery stent placement
History of pancreatic cancer
History of pancreaticoduodenectomy
Intestinal metaplasia of gastric mucosa
Assessment:
Biliary obstruction-status post successful ERCP with metal stent placement. Hepatic enzymes have normalized. All stents have been removed. Will repeat labs in 3 months with consideration of further biliary intervention based on hepatic enzyme levels
Abnormal hepatic enzymes-resolved, likely sequelae of the biliary obstruction. These have normalized
Cirrhosis-May be related to either previous chemotherapy or perhaps underlying fatty liver disease. No overt complications of cirrhosis and imaging has shown no structural disease. There are no esophageal varices. Continue clinical follow-up every 3 to 6 months with imaging to be performed at those intervals given high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.
History of pancreatic cancer-no evidence of radiographic recurrence
Anemia-Etiology for recent acute blood loss anemia is unclear, although the differential includes diverticular hemorrhage which appeared to have been self-limited or hemorrhoidal bleeding. Will continue monitoring of CBC and iron indices, as well as micronutrient levels especially given history of pancreaticoduodenectomy. I will also refer him to nutritionist as he has some questions regarding specifics regarding macronutrient supplementation

Assessment:
Esophageal structure- biopsies show chronic inflammation. He denies dysphasia at this time. He was asked to call our office if he develops any difficulty swallowing to be set up for an EGD dilation
.. Proctitis- path benign on colonoscopy. And he is asymptomatic. This does not require any further work up at this time as it's likely a benign self limiting process
GERD -- doing well and asymptomatic on BID PPI. Now that we are sure his esophagitis has healed we will try to reduce his dosing of PPI to once daily. He was asked to continue the AM dosing in DC the PM dosing.  If his symptoms change at all he can increase his dosing back up to twice daily
Pancreatic cystic lesion -- Will get pancreatic protocol CT scan to evaluate given previously noted lesion in 2023 w/o f/u. He is very claustrophobic and will avoid MRI if possible. He never had this done when ordered at the beginning of the year Reorder today

She has had some lower left abdominal pain, like someone is stabbing a knife in her abdomen. This has resolved and happened about three weeks ago. Heating pad has helped with this. Pain was present for six weeks and during this time she had intermittent issues with nausea. She saw her OBGYN and PCP and everything looked ok. She was told to follow up with GI.
She does not have a family history of colon cancer. No unintentional weight loss. No acid reflux/heartburn. In the morning she does have coffee in the morning and after that she does have to clear her throat. GERD is more diet related. No difficulty swallowing. No blood in the stool.

Assessment:
79F w PMH HTN DM HLD hypothyroid breast CA s/p mastectomy/XRT referred for eval of R abd pain, N/V, loss of appetite.  Chronic RUQ/RLQ pain with extensive workup in the past and possibly a positional component.  We discussed that timing of her pain after her prior hysterectomy (for possible uterine malignancy?) suggests possible GYN or scar tissue etiology.  But given findings of gastritis on CT with loss of appetite and dysphagia I do think EGD would be reasonable, although benefit of repeat CT or SBFT likely low yield especially given chronicity.  Also discussed changing PPI and increasing dose.
- Pantoprazole 40 daily instead of omeprazole.
- EGD at NTGIC.

Establish care--transfer from outside GI provider
History of Present Illness:
Linda Petrikovic is a 80 year old female patient who is seen today for an initial visit.
The patient is here to establish care with Dr. Gutta, transferring from Dr. Gorrepati. She was initially evaluated at Azle Hospital earlier this year for severe diarrhea and underwent an extensive workup, including EGD and colonoscopy (03/2025) performed by Dr. Gorrepati. EGD revealed an esophageal ulcer. Colonoscopy revealed lymphocytic colitis. Recommended repeat EGD and she was started on budesonide but discontinued it due to adverse reactions and does not wish to restart this therapy. A recent repeat EGD (08/2025) to assess healing of the ulcer was normal with normal pathology as well.
About 3 weeks ago, she was evaluated by her PCP, who ordered stool studies and labs: Stool studies and labs both were normal. Patient was noted to have EPI from previous stool studies, though the patient was not aware of this and she is not on Creon or other pancreatic enzyme replacement.
She was prescribed Lomotil for 1 week by her PCP which significantly improved her diarrhea, but symptoms recur after completing the medication.
She was also recently evaluated by cardiologist Dr. Newman for new onset atrial fibrillation, who recommended starting Eliquis, but advised deferring until discussing with GI given her recent history of esophageal ulcer. She has not started Eliquis at this time. Currently, she reports 5-6 loose to watery stools per day, denies abdominal pain or rectal pain. Denies overt GI bleeding, denies upper GI symptoms including reflux, dyspepsia or dysphagia. Denies other GI alarm symptoms.

GERD (e)
Assessment:
1. Chronic diarrhea: Lymphocytic colitis–colonoscopy confirm lymphocytic colitis. Symptoms improved with Lomotil but recurred after discontinuation of budesonide not tolerated due to adverse effects. Stool studies and labs are negative for infection or other metabolic causes. Given budesonide intolerance, we can consider alternative therapies such as bismuth subsalicylate, loperamide. Avoid dairy products, fried food, spicy food, sugary foods/drinks.
2. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency: Not currently on pancreatic enzyme therapy, stool studies from 06/2025 showed low fecal elastase. Trial of pancreatic enzymes replacement (Creon). If no improvement we can consider lomotil.
3. History of esophageal ulcer: Nonhealing, confirmed by recent normal EGD and biopsies. Continue standard reflux precautions.
4. Atrial fibrillation: Recently diagnosed; Eliquis recommended by cardiology but deferred due to prior ulcer. Coordinate with cardiology regarding anticoagulation and now that ulcer is healed.
5. GERD: Stable, GERD diet discussed in detail.
All questions answered.

Abdominal pain and gas
History of Present Illness:
32-year-old female with no significant PMH seen today for evaluation of constipation, gas, heartburn.
Outside records reviewed:
– 8/12/2025 PCP OV for abdominal pain. Previously tested for H. pylori positive in 2024 and treated with antibiotics. Has a family history of esophageal cancer and concerned about this.
Patient mentions that GI issues had been ongoing for many months. She was having a need to burp over and over and seen by PCP in 11/2024. Diagnosed with H pylori and completed 14 day abx regimen with 3 meds. She felt better during the course of this. In 5/2025, started feeling it again and this time, H pylori testing was negative.
She is having intermittent symptoms now with some good days that are asymptomatic. She will feel gas trapped in the epigastrium that is not relieved with burping. She notes some increased flatulence as well.
She did have an episode of constipation a few weeks ago. This was isolated and not a chronic issue.

Assessment:
32-year-old female with no significant PMH seen today for evaluation of constipation, gas, heartburn.
Constipation: Patient had isolated constipation in the last few weeks. Likely is contributing to her bloating and gas production. She is already on fiber supplements and this is largely resolved.
– Continue fiber supplementation and good water intake.
Epigastric discomfort, history of H. pylori: Patient has tested negative for H. pylori recently and was off of all antibiotics and antacid medications in preparation for the test. She is concerned primarily with her family history of esophageal cancer. She does not have any red flag symptoms including dysphagia, unexpected weight loss, melena which is very reassuring. Discussed with her that we could just try omeprazole for 1 month course as gastritis/mild esophagitis is the likely cause of her symptoms but patient is also concerned. Offered EGD to take a look down given her family history and ensure no other significant pathology.
– EGD for further evaluation
– If patient does not want to pursue EGD, can use omeprazole as needed
– Can also use Tums/Pepcid as needed–recommendations given

Abdominal Pain, Constipation, Hemorrhoids
History of Present Illness:
9/8/25
This is a 38-year-old man seen today in consultation for abdominal pain, constipation, and hemorrhoids. Consent was obtained for recording and use of AI scribe software. The patient reports experiencing right upper and right lower quadrant abdominal pain. A CT scan conducted at Medical City Plano revealed gallstones and constipation. The patient has never undergone endoscopy or colonoscopy in the past. He has experienced this abdominal pain for a couple of months, describing it as a dull pain, with episodes persisting for a few days at a time. He noted the pain is less severe than a past kidney stone, rating it a 2 or 3 out of 10 in intensity. There is no associated nausea. The patient sometimes associates the pain with bowel movements, experiencing a sensation of incomplete evacuation. He also reports a history of hemorrhoids for about three years, with occasional bleeding, particularly after prolonged sitting.
His constipation is characterized by infrequent bowel movements and incomplete evacuation, despite the urge to defecate. He was prescribed Miralax, which provided some relief but was not completely effective. The patient does not report significant gas or bloating. He denies any significant change in weight or appetite, although he notes his appetite is generally low due to taking Zep-Bound (10 mg for nearly a year), which he stopped briefly to assess its impact on his symptoms.
There is no known family history of colon cancer or colon polyps. His liver function tests are reported as normal, and other recent lab results include elevated LDL cholesterol (138), triglycerides (147), low HDL (38), and low vitamin D (28). His complete metabolic profile, TSH, T4, free T4, T3, CBC, B12, and folate levels are within normal limits.
- CT scan at Medical City Plano showed gallstones and constipation.

Risks, Benefits, and Alternatives to the procedure were discussed with the patient including but not limited to bleeding, infection, perforation, missed lesions, incomplete exams, injury to internal organs, nausea, shortness of breath, pneumonia, cardiopulmonary events, and other anesthesia-related side effects. The patient verbalized understanding of the procedures and its risks, and agrees to undergo testing. All questions were answered. Handout Given.
- Initiate a high-fiber diet. I would like the patient to increase fluid intake to at least 60 oz of fluid daily if not more. I would also like the patient to start a chewable fiber supplement 5-10 g daily.
- Continue Miralax, considering either a double dose or twice daily dosing to improve bowel movements.
- Consider an ultrasound of the gallbladder to better assess the size and number of gallstones.  I will place a recall to check sonogram in six months
- Discuss with the patient the option of surgical consultation with Dr. London for potential future management of gallstones if symptomatic,  or if he has a gallstone greater than 2 cm.
- Recommend vitamin D supplementation to address the low vitamin D level.
- Monitor and manage cholesterol levels through diet and possibly medication, if necessary.
-  consider treatment with hemorrhoid banding for his hemorrhoids to follow, unfortunately Cigna does not appropriately cover the Hemwell procedure indication not be performed at the time of colonoscopy. Risks, Benefits, and Alternatives to the procedure were discussed with the patient including but not limited to bleeding, infection, perforation, incomplete exams, injury to internal organs, nausea, shortness of breath, contact allergy, or other side effects.

Here to establish GI care, Per Pt,  He was Dx with e coli and was hospitalized for 11 days. Pt was also Dx with colitis. Pt still c/o abd pain, bloating and gas
History of Present Illness:
Thomas Mitchell is a 73 year old  male patient who is seen at the request of Swatee Mohapatra for a consultation/initial visit.  He had a recent history of colitis and E. Coli and HUS.   He went to the ER on 8/17 and was started on an amoxicillin abx.  He went to the PCP, and lab work showed acute kidney renal issues.  He was then sent back to the hospital, and he was started on 4 different IV abx.  The next day, they stopped all abx.  His Cr was 4.8.  He was monitored for the next 11 days and given fluids.  No dialysis.
Most recent labs showed Cr 1.3.  Sodium is normal.  Hgb 11.7 (previously at 10).  CT scan on 8/17 showed a moderate wall thickening of the transverse, descending, sigmoid colon.  On 8/29, CT scan showed diffuse wall thickening of the descending, sigmoid and upper rectum.  The E. coli toxin was found in his stool.
Of note, wife had diarrhea on 8/15, and her symptoms resolved after a day.  He then got symptoms of diarrhea 1-2 days later.  He then had blood in his stools.  That was also what prompted him to go to the hospital.  She was sick on 8/13, and he got sick the next day or two.  He was not having a fever, but he did have some chills.   He has not had a colonoscopy done, but he has done a Cologuard most recently done in 2024.  The cologuard tests have been negative.
He has always been very regular with his BMs.  He is slowly getting better.  When he returned from the hospital, and it was painful.  The stools have been better - they are stolid and light brown in color.  He has been careful with his diet. He is not on fiber right now.  He is eating bland overall.  He started probiotics after coming home from the hospital.

He has an E.coli infection found in his stool that ultimately led to HUS after abx treatment.  He is recovering from this now, but CT did show an extensive colitis.  While this is likely infectious, he will need a colonoscopy to evaluate further.  He has never had a colonoscopy done before, but he has had a few negative Cologuard studies.  DIscussed diet at length.  Stay bland and low fiber for another week, and then he can gradually step up his diet.  No need for iron therapy, but he can take for a couple weeks if desired.  Ok to start low-fat red meat now.
