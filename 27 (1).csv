Episodic fecal incontinence
History of Present Illness:
Ronda Douglas is a 52 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit.
Patient last seen October 2024. She has a.m. nausea vomiting. She has been on omeprazole at supper and famotidine at bedtime but has had no improvement. She has episodes of a.m. nausea vomiting every 2 to 3 months. We talked about Ozempic and she tells me she has been off of that as long as 6 months and that has not helped. She has had a gastric emptying study that was normal. Patient has never been on Voquezna.
She also tells me that she has episodes of fecal incontinence at night. Patient had a colonoscopy in October 24. She had mild grade 1 internal hemorrhoids but no other findings. I have suggested we try the new medication.

Steatorrhea
Screen for colon cancer
Preprocedural examination
Assessment:
Patient has a chronic diarrhea for the past few years and description of steatorrhea/fat in the stool. Could be due to chronic pancreas issues versus mismatch in timing (of food entering intestines / pancreas enzymes entering intestines given her post bypass status) versus dumping syndrome versus traditional colonic pathology (IBD, microscopic colitis). Patient also needs to be brought up-to-date with CRC screening
- Will schedule routine screening colonoscopy with low threshold for colon biopsies.
- Will check fecal fat, pancreatic elastase
- Recommended trial of psyllium/Metamucil for right now to see if that helps slow down the stools.
- 45 minutes spent on encounter, 25 minutes with patient, 20 minutes reviewing records, documenting, placing orders..
Plan:	Recommended low fat, low cholesterol diet and exercise to achieve ideal body weight.*
Follow-up with PCP for elevated blood pressure reading*
Fecal elastase

Beth Solomon is a 66 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit.  She notes that she has not used the Miralax, but also notes that in the past when doing it, it did not help.  She has tried fiber pills, and that did not help.  She was asked to use Trulance last time, but she did not use it.   She has been gaining weight, and she is back on a GLP-1.  She does feel the GLP-1 may cause some constipation for her.  She has used Linzess in the past.

529,09-11-2025,5497320,99214,K21.9,R13.14,,,"Chief Complaint:	Dysphagia
History of Present Illness:
Jill Floyd is a 49-year-old female with a past medical history of GERD, asthma, multiple sclerosis, sleep apnea, hypertension, and endometriosis who presents for evaluation of new onset dysphagia, early satiety, and shortness of breath. She was previously evaluated in May 2025 for vomiting, thought to be secondary to Wegovy use, which has since resolved after discontinuing the medication.
Esophagram on 05/12/2025 noted mild esophageal dysmotility.
EGD on 05/19/2025 noted a normal esophagus, mild antral erythema, and normal duodenum. Esophageal biopsies were consistent with reflux esophagitis with no evidence of Barrett's esophagus or eosinophilic esophagitis. Gastric biopsies were negative for H. pylori.
The primary concern is new-onset dysphagia to solids and pills, along with early satiety and associated shortness of breath, which began approximately one week ago. She reports a sensation of food and pills becoming lodged in the chest, which is a new symptom not present during her evaluation in May. This is associated with a feeling of fullness after only a few bites of food, which then provokes shortness of breath. She denies regurgitation of food. She also reports a recent increase in eructation. No significant reflux. She recently stopped taking omeprazole two days ago at the direction of her nephrologist and was advised by her asthma provider to taper off it using over-the-counter Pepcid on alternate days.
She also reports a new onset of significant lower extremity edema, abdominal distention, and exertional dyspnea over the last week. She was seen by her nephrologist for new abnormal kidney function labs from July and August 2025, consistent with stage 3 kidney disease. She was started on HCTZ two days ago with a 6-pound weight loss since yesterday. She denies any known liver disease or cardiac history. She is scheduled for a renal ultrasound, lower extremity ultrasound, and chest x-ray today.

Dysphagia, pharyngoesophageal phase (e)
Assessment:
Dysphagia and early satiety: New symptoms in the setting of known mild esophageal dysmotility and reflux esophagitis noted on prior evaluation in May. However, at that time her primary concern was vomiting, which has now resolved. She was not having dysphagia at the time of her esophagram and EGD. The workup for her significant fluid overload and acute kidney injury should take precedence.
- Repeat barium esophagram with 13-mm tablet to evaluate for any new structural abnormality or worsening dysmotility.
- Will defer repeat EGD at this time given active work up underway for new diagnosis of renal dysfunction and anasarca
- If esophagram is unrevealing and symptoms persist after other medical issues are clarified, may need Repeat EGD for more extensive biopsies or referral to Baylor esophageal center for dysmotility evaluation.
- Advised to taper omeprazole as suggested by her other provider and use Pepcid as an alternative.
Reflux esophagitis: History of reflux esophagitis on biopsy. No significant GERD symptoms at this time but does have increased belching
- Continue plan to taper omeprazole per the advice of her nephrologist and use Pepcid as an alternative for symptom management.
Abnormal kidney function and anasarca: Currently being evaluated by nephrology.
- Await results of renal ultrasound, lower extremity ultrasound, and chest x-ray. She will have us copied on the results.
- If she has evidence of ascites may need to consider additional evaluation for any underlying cardiac or liver dysfunction (per her report she believes recent labs showed normal liver enzymes)
- Continue HCTZ as prescribed by nephrology.
Follow-up will be pending review of the esophagram

dysphagia
History of Present Illness:
73-year-old male referred for difficulty swallowing by Brandi Gosdin, PA. Known to me from evaluation in 2021 when he was referred for colonoscopy. Last visit was in 2021.
This 73-year-old gentleman presents for evaluation of dysphagia. He reports a sensation of food getting stuck in his lower chest, which is then associated with production of saliva that he spits up. He finds that drinking milk or creamer helps the food to pass. He was prescribed omeprazole by his primary care provider, which has significantly improved his symptoms. He notes that if he forgets to take the medication for a day or two, the symptoms recur. He also reports a history of frequent heartburn and acid sensations prior to starting the medication. He denies any other reflux symptoms.
His last colonoscopy was in 2021, at which time a polyp, consistent with a sessile serrated adenoma, was removed from the ascending colon. There was also self-limited ischemic colitis noted at that time. He has remained asymptomatic from that. He was advised to return in five years for a repeat colonoscopy, which is now due in 2026. He reports having two polyps removed during that procedure, and also two polyps removed in a colonoscopy five years prior to that. He has not had a prior upper endoscopy.
Pertinent upper GI symptoms include dysphagia and a history of heartburn. He denies nausea, vomiting, bloating, or other reflux symptoms. Pertinent lower GI symptoms are negative; he denies change in bowel habits, constipation, diarrhea, blood in stool, or rectal bleeding.
GI medications include omeprazole, which he takes for his symptoms.
Past medical history is significant for asthma, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. Past surgical history is significant for colonoscopy with polypectomy in 2021.
Social history includes working in construction. He denies use of any blood thinners. He has a family history of colon cancer in his sister. His mother also had a mass, but it was not investigated before her death.
Test results reviewed:

Dysphagia, unspecified (e)
Assessment:
Assessment & Plan:
- Dysphagia
- History of sessile serrated adenoma
1. Dysphagia: The presentation is suggestive of acid reflux-related dysphagia, given the significant improvement with omeprazole. However, given the new onset of dysphagia in a 73-year-old, an underlying structural cause, including malignancy, needs to be ruled out.
- Plan to proceed with an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to evaluate the esophagus.
- Will continue omeprazole.
2. Colon Cancer Screening: He is due for a surveillance colonoscopy in 2026 due to a history of a sessile serrated adenoma and a family history of colon cancer. Given he requires sedation for the EGD, we discussed performing both procedures concurrently to avoid two separate preparations and sedation events.
- Plan to schedule a colonoscopy at the same time as the EGD.
- Discussed the procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives. Stressed the need for an excellent bowel preparation.
After Visit Summary:
- Your main issue is trouble swallowing. While the medicine we have you on seems to be helping, which suggests it may be related to acid reflux, we need to be sure there is no other cause.
- We will schedule you for an upper endoscopy (EGD), which is a scope to look at your esophagus and stomach.
- Since you are also due for a repeat colonoscopy next year to check for polyps, we discussed doing both procedures at the same time. This is more convenient and avoids needing sedation twice.
- My assistant, Amy, will contact you to get these procedures scheduled.
- Please continue taking your omeprazole as prescribed. It is working well for your symptoms.
- You will need to arrange for someone, such as your wife, to drive you to and from the procedure, as you will receive sedation and will not be able to drive for the rest of the day.
Plan:	EGD/Colonoscopy with Anesthesia Provider/CRNA who is hereby directed and authorized to administer anesthesia - 43235/45378
Clenpiq 10 mg-3.5 gram- 12 gram/175 mL Drink 2 bottle by mouth split dose as directed
High fiber diet
Resume taking current medications
Additional Notes:	Additional Recommendations/Instructions:
1. Today we discussed your upcoming procedure:
- We discussed the importance of an excellent preparation to minimize the risk of missed polyps. **Please read the instructions for the preparation one week prior to your exam.**
- Risks include sedation related risks, perforation, immediate or delayed bleeding, infection, as well as the low risk of incomplete procedure due to retained food, poor preparation, anatomy, or a large/difficult polyp, requiring a repeat.

History of Present Illness:
David Walker is an 81-year-old male with a past medical history of obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and fatty liver who presents for evaluation of a positive stool test for blood and anemia. He was last seen in this practice in 2009 for elevated liver enzymes. Reported history is a bit tangential.
Reports that he was recently seen at the VA which noted new finding of anemia. He subsequently had stool based test which was positive for blood in the stool. These records are not available for review. He is uncertain if any specific iron studies were obtained. He is presently not on iron supplementation. He denies any hematochezia, melena or any overt signs of bleeding. He does endorse a change in his bowel habits for approximately 1 year characterized by alternating patterns of constipation consisting of up to 2 days without a bowel movement. He will then subsequently have a few bowel movements the following day. Stool is formed, described as small soft pieces. He reports occasional episodes of minor fecal incontinence if stool consistency is loose. He notes mild, intermittent abdominal discomfort associated with gas. Denies nausea, vomiting, reflux. He did sustain an approximately 50 pound weight loss after having COVID-pneumonia in 2021, now believes his weight has been fairly stable. He reports occasional episodes of dysphagia to solid foods, such as chicken. Described a sensation of food becoming stuck in his upper chest/throat, usually requiring liquids to help it pass. His last colonoscopy was over 10 years ago. He denies any known cardiac or pulmonary conditions, no anticoagulants. However, he states that at some point he was to have possible Ortho surgery, however there was an unspecified concern regarding his heart. He was seen by Dr. Hussain for workup, he believes testing all returned negative but he is uncertain of details.  Denies chest pain, shortness of breath, edema.

History of Present Illness:
Heather Beaird is a 43-year-old female with a history of chronic idiopathic constipation, GERD, and post-hysterectomy status, presenting with ongoing, severe symptoms.
She reports persistent constipation for the past 2-4 years, requiring a combination of Linzess, lubiprostone, Miralax, and occasional Dulcolax suppositories or Prunelax to achieve a bowel movement. She aims for one bowel movement daily but often goes 2-3 days without, leading to increased discomfort. Symptoms are associated with significant bloating, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. The nausea is unpredictable and can occur with or without food intake.
She reports a history of entering menopause at age 36. She had a post-hysterectomy appointment with her OB/GYN this morning (09/11/2025) and was found to have poor absorption of her hormone cream. She was started on an oral estradiol 5 mg pill and an increased dose of testosterone cream today. She hopes hormonal regulation may improve her GI symptoms. She has seen Dr. Hughston for these issues in the past. She also notes having a problematic internal hemorrhoid but is reluctant to undergo surgical removal due to the painful recovery.
Her last visit was on 03/07/2025 for severe upper abdominal pain, which was evaluated in the ER. A CT scan on 03/05/2025 showed no acute abnormalities. Labs were notable for a slightly elevated lipase of 87. A subsequent EGD was performed by Dr. Hughston on 03/19/2025, which showed a normal esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. Biopsies were normal with no evidence of Celiac Sprue or H. pylori.
Her last colonoscopy in August 2024 was normal except for internal hemorrhoids.
Reports: abdominal pain, bloating/gas, constipation, nausea, vomiting, fatigue.
Denies: heartburn/reflux, difficulty swallowing, anorectal pain/itching, blood in stool, change in bowel habits, diarrhea, incontinence of stool, black tarry stools,: fever, loss of appetite, night sweats, weight gain, weight loss.

GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease)
Assessment:
- Chronic idiopathic constipation:
Symptoms are poorly controlled despite using multiple prescription (Linzess, lubiprostone) and over-the-counter laxatives. The current regimen is extensive and concerning for long-term effects. The potential contribution of hormonal imbalance and pelvic floor dysfunction was discussed. She will discontinue Linzess and lubiprostone and start Motegrity.
- Nausea and vomiting:
Reports significant nausea, sometimes leading to emesis. Dicyclomine provides insufficient relief and has a side effect of constipation. Will start Compazine for better nausea control, which does not cause constipation.
- Hormonal Imbalance:
Recently started on oral estradiol and increased testosterone by her GYN. The potential link between hormonal changes and GI dysmotility was discussed. Improvement in GI symptoms will be monitored as her hormone levels stabilize.
- Pelvic Floor Dysfunction:
Discussed as a possible etiology for her refractory constipation. If symptoms do not improve with medication changes and hormone therapy, referral to Dr. Baucom for anorectal manometry and balloon expulsion testing will be considered.
Start Motegrity once daily. Discontinue Linzess and lubiprostone.
May continue Miralax, 1-4 capfuls daily as needed for constipation.
Start Compazine, one tablet every 6-8 hours as needed for nausea and vomiting.
Prescriptions for Motegrity and Compazine sent to Alpine Drug.
Follow up in the clinic in 6 weeks to assess response to medication changes.
Advised to reach out if symptoms worsen or do not improve.

9/6/2024 (Lacey): 24 y/o M presents for hospital follow up on severe ulcerative pancolitis. He was discharged last week on prednisone and oral/rectal mesalamine. He is having lower abdominal pain that has gotten worse since the hospital. He's having 10-12 bowel movements a day, with hematochezia. Dicyclomine isn't helping much.
10/7/2024 (Lacey): 25 y/o M presents for follow up on severe pancolitis. After our last visit, he ended up getting admitted for infliximab administration because he was getting too sick to wait on insurance approval. He got a second dose on 9/30. He feels tremendously better. He is having 2-3 bowel movements each morning, then 1-2 in the evening. Stools are ranging from loose to formed. He's having a little blood on toilet paper with wiping, and not every time. 90% of the time, he can distinguish gas from stool to pass.
2/7/2025 (Lacey): 25 y/o M presents for follow up on ulcerative pancolitis.  He reports that he has been having significant improvement in GI symptoms, to the point of resolution.  Bowel movements are normal.  No hematochezia, no abdominal pain.  He is able to tell the difference between passing gas and stool.

Pt currently on Avsola 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks. Recommend colonoscopy to assess for endoscopic remission on Avsola - pt will have to change his insurance after this month so will see if any availability for scope prior to end of this month. Discussed importance of notifying clinic as soon as he has new insurance info so we can submit for Avsola to prevent delay in therapy (advised to send portal message and card given for our insurance department if he has any questions about if new insurance accepted by clinic). His last infusion was 9/4/25 and next due 10/30/25. Recommend checking drug level/Ab prior to next infusion if no delay in therapy due to skin complaints and some more intermittent diarrhea in the 1-2 weeks leading up to infusion. Will continue labs with every other infusion, due for annual TB so will order this today.
Plan:	Colonoscopy with Anesthesia Provider/CRNA who is hereby directed and authorized to administer anesthesia - 45378 - this month if at all possible
Please notify clinic as soon as you know what your new insurance will be so we can submit for approval of Avsola (or other Infliximab formulation)

History of Present Illness:
Andrew Heine is a 27-year-old male with a past medical history of premature birth, ADHD, and PVCs, who presents for evaluation of persistently elevated liver enzymes. Seen with mother present. He was previously evaluated for this in 2022 by Dr. Vemula at which time serologic workup was notable for a positive smooth muscle antibody and ANA. A subsequent liver biopsy was completely normal, and his liver enzymes normalized on 07/08/2022.
Recent Abdominal ultrasound: Normal appearing liver, gallbladder, and biliary ducts. No suspicious lesions or fatty changes noted.
Recent laboratory tests last month noted a mildly elevated ALT 57 with a normal AST 26, alkaline phosphatase 69, and total bilirubin 0.4. CBC was normal with platelets of 290. TSH was normal. Cholesterol and triglycerides were elevated.
The primary concern is persistently elevated liver enzymes over the past few years. Risk factors for MASH include a history of elevated cholesterol and triglycerides, which is reported to be familial. He was recently started on rosuvastatin for hyperlipidemia. He denies symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, jaundice, or abdominal distension. He reports rare alcohol use and denies the use of herbal supplements or smoking. No family history of liver disease or cirrhosis.

Assessment:
The patient has a history of diverticulosis complicated by diverticulitis as noted on previous CT scan imaging. We discussed the pathophysiology and natural history of diverticular disease. We focused our discussion on reducing such complications through a high fiber diet with OTC fiber supplementation along with limiting red meats and continued exercise. Per guidelines, given patient's recent episode of acute diverticulitis he should have a colonoscopy to assess for extent of diverticulosis and presence of persistent inflammation, as well as for additional lesions, including colorectal neoplasia and non-infectious colitis, which can produce similar symptoms. However, this is safest to be done 6 to 8 weeks after his episode to assure resolution of his diverticulitis prior to the procedure. This is in hopes of lowering risk of a potential complication, like perforation.
Plan:	Colonoscopy with Anesthesia Provider/CRNA who is hereby directed and authorized to administer anesthesia - 45378 (mid October) 6 weeks after acute episocde of diverticulitis.
Education material provided on diverticulosis.
High fiber diet, patient education materials generated by EMR
Risks and benefits statement: The procedure and its preparation, benefits, alternatives, and limitations were explained to the patient or legal guardian. The risks and potential complications including but not limited to perforation, bleeding, infection, missed lesion, aspiration and other complications of sedation were reviewed. The patient or legal guardian verbalized understanding and wishes to proceed.
Additional Notes:	This patient has been evaluated and is a candidate for an Outpatient Surgery Center."

History of Present Illness:
20 yo F w/ PMHx of IBS presents for f/u. Last seen on 7/18/25 to establish care and discuss GERD, regurgitation, N/V, changes in bowel habits, blood/mucus in stool, and abdominal pain. She underwent bidirectional scopes on 8/11/25. EGD showed no endoscopic esophageal abnormality to explain dysphagia, though dilation was noted along w/ erythematous gastric mucosa. Colonoscopy revealed hemorrhoids on perianal exam and patchy congestion in the terminal ileum, and the remainder of the colon appeared normal. Pathology showed minimal chronic gastritis, mild nonspecific chronic inflammation in the distal esophagus, and acute ileitis. Pentasa (mesalamine) was recommended but not started due to cost/insurance issues.
Today, she reports ongoing GI sx, which she believes are IBS-related. She describes epigastric pain 1-2x/day, alternating bowel habits, and infrequent rectal bleeding (a few times per year, last episode prior to colonoscopy). She has 1-3 BMs daily or every other day, typically Bristol 3-5. Abdominal pain occurs after meals and presents as mid-abdominal cramping or bloating, sometimes sharp, resolving within about 30 minutes. She also notes frequent belching and suspects she may be swallowing too much air. Reflux/heartburn occurs once per week, and she experiences chest pain 2-3x/week. She discontinued acid suppression following EGD. Currently using water and Costco fiber gummies for sx relief. Since her colonoscopy, she has had increased urinary frequency (14-15x/day) and is unsure if it is related. She has also increased her water intake. Recently seen by PCP, UA was done, and UTI was suspected, w/ abx starting tomorrow. No other current UGI or LGI sx reported.

Assessment:
Patient is a 79-year-old white female who presents today for follow-up on increased GERD symptoms. She reports her increased symptoms started about 4 to 6 weeks ago, and is having breakthrough reflux symptoms several times a week. Of note patient has been on GLP-1 medications in the past, most recently on Mounjaro, states she stopped this 6 weeks ago. Patient states she is taking her pantoprazole 40 mg in the morning, does not take with food. She is also using Pepcid AC over-the-counter as needed. We discussed any changes in her diet, exercise, medication regimen approximately a month ago that could be contributing to her increased GERD symptoms. She reports she was on a weeklong cruise to Alaska. She reports that she is eating larger meals, eating late at night, and reports since being off the GLP-1 she is hungry all day long and eats all day. She states she typically does not eat breakfast, does not eat until around 1030 or 11:00 AM. She reports she often eats late at night and lays down quickly afterwards. She reports burning in the midsternal area that is often relieved with over-the-counter Pepcid. She denies any overt abdominal pain, no hemoptysis, no nausea or vomiting and no weight loss.
We discussed need to improve lifestyle changes to help lower her GERD symptoms. Recommend weight loss, smaller frequent meals, eating 3 to 4 hours prior to lying flat at night, avoiding acidic and spicy foods, and avoiding GLP-1 medications. We will increase her pantoprazole to twice daily dosing and ensure patient is taking medication with food. She will follow-up with me in 6 weeks for symptom check or sooner if new or worsening symptoms arise.

History of Present Illness:
Axel was seen last year with persistent diarrhea following liver transplant presumed due to EPI based on stool testing for which he was being treated with Creon. He was actually having bouts of urgency and so was advised to take a bottle of mag citrate followed by nightly Miralax. These measures yielded no appreciable improvement. He stopped the Creon over a year ago due to the expense (almost $5000/mo) and believes the diarrhea was somewhat worse off the medication. He has continued to have ongoing diarrhea since. He typically has 4-5 loose or watery stools/d, usually after meals, which may at times be ""explosive"" with ""a lot of gas"". This may be associated with considerable urgency to the point of incontinence. He uses an OTC antidiarrheal (? Imodium) which helps ""a little bit"". As before, there is no associated abd pain or cramping and he notes only occasional mild bleeding from hemorrhoids. His weight is stable. He has noted that the diarrhea seems to subside whenever he takes antibiotics. Abd/pelvis CT last month was negative.

Diagnosis:	1) Chronic diarrhea -- while previously attributed to EPI, he does not have any history to suggest chronic pancreatitis and imaging has shown no pancreatic calcification. The transient improvement with with antibiotics raises the possibility of SIBO though he has not undergone intestinal surgery. Microscopic colitis would be a consideration. Finally, the clear temporal association with liver transplant raises the possibility this could be due to sirolimus.
2) Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency
3) Fecal urgency
4) Fecal incontinence
5) Bleeding external hemorrhoids
6) GE reflux -- under good control now on once daily PPI.

History of Present Illness:
Janet Coger is a 69 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit. Since our last visit, her Ozempic dosage was decreased due to continued burning abdominal pain. Her abdominal pain has improved on lower dose. She does report intermittent RLQ pain that seems to be correlated with constipation. She is taking Miralax but admits she has not been consistent with daily use. She is trying to be better about this. She did run out of fiber gummies 3-4 days ago and says she can tell she has not been taking them. She does have Hyoscyamine at home but has not taken in several months and forgot what it was for. She denies blood in stool. She is back to taking PPI once daily which seems to be keeping reflux controlled, especially now that her Ozempic was decreased. She has lost 14 pounds since her last visit and says her blood sugars have rarely been above 120-140.

History of Present Illness:
Jessica is back following up with me for some recent symptoms that she has been having. She is reporting symptoms of fullness or discomfort in the epigastric area that feels like a brick and she puts her fist to the right in the epigastric area. She does not feel well after meals. She is having some thick mucus and in the back of her throat. She is occasionally getting queasy or nauseous. She induced vomiting 1 time to make yourself feel better last week. Interestingly, after bowel movements she sometimes feels a little brief nausea or chills. She is moving her bowel daily after coffee but she says it might not move if she did have coffee. She does not feel like she empties well.
She is not drinking alcohol. She has been taking vitamin B12 supplement. She briefly took some sort of colostrum recovery supplement. I started her on omeprazole 20 mg daily last week and she has had mild improvement over the weekend. She has not had to take any Zofran but I gave her some of that as well. She has lost 13 pounds since we have seen her last through a concerted effort at healthier diet and some increase in physical activity.  We tested with h.pylori breath test back in Nov 2023 and that was negative.  Her last EGD was in 2016 and was essentially negative with negative biopsies from all three areas.  She is not on opiates or drinking alcohol.

Wayne is following up with me in GI clinic with his history of esophageal stricture, small hiatal hernia, and eosinophilic esophagitis. He has had EGD with dilation in 2011, 2017, and now 2025. He has not had severe stricture each time I have dilated him up to 18 mm with mucosal effect. Biopsies in 2017 and 2025 show eosinophils and most recently there were 55 eosinophils per high-power field in the upper endoscopy done this year. I put him on the pantoprazole after the procedure and I was seeing him back in follow-up. He reports that he was not having heartburn or chest discomfort just dysphagia that led to the presentation in the referral earlier this year in April.
He has been on proton pump inhibitor for several months since the procedure and he reports that his swallowing function is pretty normal and he is not having any reflux or chest discomfort. He also denies any lower GI symptoms. He has had 2 colonoscopies 1 was in 2005 with polyps and then most recently we did 1 in July 2020 where he had 2 tubular adenomas and hemorrhoids found and a 7-year follow-up was recommended.
He also mentioned that after our discussion following the procedure, he has been trying to perform and 2 food elimination diet with milk and wheat.

History of Present Illness:
Barbara is back in GI clinic follow-up of her left-sided ulcerative colitis. The last time that I saw disease activity was in 2015 that was right around the time that we started azathioprine. She was on balsalazide at that time and she continues on those 2 medicines today and she has been in remission ever since. We did colonoscopy in May of this year there was no disease activity there were several polyps which were tubular adenomas.
I did lower her azathioprine from 200 mg down to 150 mg at that visit. She has not had any flare or increase in symptoms since then. It is been about 3 months. Her bowel movements have slowed down a little bit since she has been started on Ozempic. She is moving them every other day and are getting a little firm. She is not having any reflux or dysphagia. She does have a ventral hernia she is not having any pain or problems from that. She tells me that she avoids gluten and it causes gas and bloating and it makes her want to eat more.

History of Present Illness:
Patricia Shelton is a 63 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit. She has a history of noncirrhotic portal hypertension. She had grade 1 varices noted on her last upper endoscopy in August 2024. She is on nadolol 40 mg nightly and seems to be tolerating that well. She has a history of breast and renal cancer. It is thought that she may develop febrile hypertensive issues from her chemotherapy. She denies any blood in the stool or abdominal pain. She does have a history of constipation and we started her on Linzess at her last office visit. She states that has been working very well for her. She typically has 1 bowel movement per day now. If she eats too soon after taking her medication she states she will get some diarrhea but otherwise is tolerating it well.

Assessment:
63-year-old female with history of noncirrhotic portal hypertension. She is due for repeat upper endoscopy so we will set that up at the hospital. She will continue on her nadolol as well. She also has chronic constipation but it seems to be much improved since starting Linzess so she will continue on that. She does tell me that she had a CT scan and labs done approximately 3 months ago. Highlands so we will get those records and not repeat any imaging or labs at this time. I will plan to see her back in clinic in 6 months for routine follow-up or sooner if she has any issues in the interim.

History of Present Illness:
3/10/2025:
Denise Reynolds is a 60 year old female who is seen today for follow-up. Dr. Moore started her on Reglan empirically for suspected gastroparesis. She has been taking 5 mg TID and says she cannot tell that it has helped at all. She is still having frequent nausea and vomiting of undigested food. She continues to report early satiety, excessive bloating, and periumbilical pain. She continues to have dysphagia that she says seems to be worsening. She has difficulty with solids and liquids as well as randomly on occasion. She was dilated with no resistance at 54 Fr in September. It was not especially beneficial. She has had a modified swallow study with speech that was negative as well as normal esophageal manometry. She is doing better in regards to her lower GI symptoms. She could not tolerate Colestipol and Cholestyramine powder was too expensive. She has been taking 3 Welchol tablets before bed. She is not having as much urgency and less frequent episodes of incontinence. She does have BRBPR that comes and goes periodically. She is not taking Loperamide at all as she says it makes her feel more bloated. She has not had any constipation lately. She has remained on 20 mg of Omeprazole and 10 mg of Amitriptyline.
------------------------------
5/13/2025:
Denise is back in clinic today for follow-up. She was started on 20 mg of Voquezna at last visit. She does feel that her reflux is much better on Voquezna. She took 20 mg for 8 weeks and is now taking 10 mg. She denies any change in her dysphagia. She has had increased nausea since last visit but denies vomiting. We did discontinue her Reglan as she didn't feel it was helping. She reported that Welchol was working quite well. However, she has recently had more frequent episodes of diarrhea and fecal incontinence. She has no warning when this will happen. She is taking 3 Welchol capsules at bedtime. She has not had any recent rectal bleeding. She has no new symptoms to report.
-----------------------------
9/11/2025:
Denise returns today for a follow-up visit. She is stable and has not had any major change in symptoms since our last visit. We did put her back on Reglan 5 mg TID to see if would help her nausea. She says that it has helped some. She has not had any adverse side effects. She continues to have fairly good control of her reflux on 10 mg of Voquezna. She continues to report dysphagia that remains unchanged. She had some BRBPR on Saturday and Sunday last weekend but that has since resolved. Her diarrhea and fecal incontinence remain unchanged. She is still taking 2 Welchol tablets BID which does not seem to be quite as effective as when she initially started it, but she can still tell a noticeable difference if she misses a dose.

Assessment:
Overall, she is stable with no major change in her symptoms. She does feel that Reglan has helped decrease the severity of her nausea and would like to continue it. She has not experience any adverse reactions. However, we again discussed what to watch for and to stop the Reglan immediately and notify our office should she experience any of those symptoms. Her main complaint continues to be her chronic, uncontrollable diarrhea with frequent episodes of incontinence. She initially had a fairly good response to Welchol but it has since become less effective. She had a sacral nerve stimulator placed in early 2023. She has not followed up with Dr. Tantchou since then. I recommended she request a follow-up appointment to discuss if adjustments or reprogramming may be warranted to optimize effectiveness. She will follow-up with Dr. Moore in 4 months or sooner with any problems. She did request an updated letter similar to the ones we have written in the past that she can provide to her employer regarding the status of her GI conditions.
Plan:	Continue current medications
Reglan side effects were discussed with patient, patient education materials generated by EMR. Especially tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movement of extremities, lipsmacking, grimacing, tongue motion, eye motion, finger motion, etc) which may be permanent and severely disabling and may occur even after stopping the medication. Patient understood that medication is for short term use of less than 3 months, but patient was ok for long-term/chronic use despite increased risk of side effects.  Also discussed with patient depression/suicidal ideation.  If these occur, the patient is to stop the medication immediately and call office if feels these symptoms.  Also discussed with patient somnolence/dizziness/extrapyramidal symptoms such as tremor, torticollis, akithesia, Parkinson's-like symptoms.  Patient understood that all these may be irreversible and risk increases with chronic use.

History of Present Illness:
Frederick is a very pleasant 88-year-old male with a BMI of 23 with multiple issues including diabetes and cardiovascular disease however appearing younger than his stated age that presents to the office today to see me in consultation from Dr. Marsden with abnormal liver imaging. Also able to review that by report he is having elevated bilirubin level and fib 4 serology. That being said, I have done the labs or imaging to review. The consultation does state that there may be either fibrosis versus cirrhosis of the liver. Fred clinically feels well, was not experiencing any symptoms, is not clear to me why the testing was performed however presumably it was because of abnormal liver enzymes. His weight is stable, he has no high risk activities or habits, no alcohol consumption, no symptoms or signs of encephalopathy, no GI bleeding. He is on anticoagulation and does have some ecchymosis present but no jaundice. No signs or symptoms of GI bleeding. No previous history of liver disease in the past.

Assessment:
88-year-old male with a BMI of 23 with by report abnormal imaging on ultrasound of the liver compatible with either cirrhosis versus fibrosis with an elevated bilirubin level and fib 4, all by report, labs and imaging not available to review. I will obtain these to review, no clinical findings or high risk activities present that would place him at risk other than his heart disease, diabetes and age. Further clarification is certainly necessary and for that I recommend laboratory studies below and evaluate for Gilbert syndrome, will plan for FibroScan to evaluate for fatty liver infiltration and to see if there is any quantification of fibrosis present and enhanced liver fibrosis score. Is not clear to me if there is any benefit for a more aggressive evaluation and workup at this time given his age. This was discussed with the patient and he agrees, will discuss with him further and follow-up once I have obtained his previous imaging and labs as well as the new ones ordered below. In the meantime I recommend a low carbohydrate diet and avoiding nonsteroidal medicines

9/19/2023 EGD/colonoscopy- Furrows of the mucosa was noted in the whole esophagus. Multiple cold forceps biopsies were performed for eosinophilic esophagitis in the whole esophagus. Normal mucosa noted in the stomach and duodenum. Normal colonoscopy to the cecum. Pathology: Mild chronic gastritis, negative celiac disease, negative H. pylori no significant pathologic abnormality in the esophagus, no EOE.
She also completed a SIBO breath test on 9/13/2023 which was normal. The patient denies any weight loss, denies hematochezia or melena.

Assessment:
For evaluation of dysphagia, we will perform upper endoscopy, potentially with dilation and esophageal biopsies, to assess for esophagitis, hiatal hernia, mass lesion, stricture, indirect evidence of esophageal motility, and additional potential etiologies. Should EGD and esophageal biopsies be unremarkable, we would consider esophageal motility testing.
ENT evaluation with patient possibly having LPR- did state that throat was very irritated and raw. Will resend PPI therapy, she is reluctant to start prior to procedure but will consider this.
She did discontinue Eliquis recently for 3 days prior to having blood work and tolerated this well.
With IBS symptoms overall she is doing well- she has lost around 50 pounds in the last 2 years as at times where she has flaring she will have a lot of bowel movements and significant cramping but will have sensitive stomach after this which is what has caused weight loss with decrease caloric intake.

Assessment:
Patient unfortunately had excess diarrhea with MiraLAX and then the diarrhea worsened when she started Voquezna. Unclear if it was related to either of those medications or perhaps a viral gastroenteritis that happened to occur at the initiation of these medications. Regardless she is discontinued both and her bowel movements have stabilized. Will put her back on the pantoprazole 40 mg twice a day. No alarm symptoms of necessitate endoscopy at this time but she is due for an EGD in July 2026 for follow-up of intestinal metaplasia. See full plan below.
Plan:	pantoprazole 40 mg Take 1 tablet by mouth once to twice a day as needed for acid reflux
Continue stool softener as needed
Adhere to lifestyle and dietary modifications for GERD diet as we discussed. This includes avoiding fatty and greasy foods, fried foods, tomato based foods, caffeine, carbonated drinks, coffee and alcohol. Elevate the head of your bed 6 inches. Additionally, do not eat or drink anything including water within two hours of going to bed at night or 10pm, whichever comes first. Recommend low fat, low cholesterol diet and exercise.

Dillon is a 33-year-old white male with history of Von Willebrand's and depression here today in follow up on his pan-UC initally diagnosed in 2010. He is currently well managed on Lialda 4 per day, and we discussed decreasing to 2 per day if well tolerated (has done this in the past as well, but cannot remember why he increased again). His colonoscopy in 2023 noted no evidence of active colitis nor any dysplasia on biopsies. He is due next October (2026) for increased risk screening. We did discuss the importance of routine labs for monitoring of renal/liver function, screen for anemia, etc. ideally every 6 months with at least yearly f/u.

1. Ulcerative colitis, left sided - K51.50 (Primary), Primary phenotype is inflammatory activity of the distal 40 cm of colon, associated with mechanistic escape with Humira and Entyvio. Incomplete response to Rinvoq (11/2024-8/2025) with persistent elevate FC. Skyrizi began 8/2025 with significant improvement after the first dose although potentially limited by litany of side effects including fatigue thereafter. Prednisone taper as skyrizi began 8/2025. Overall, there appears to have been some significant improvement with the second dose of Skyrizi and budesonide. Will continue full dose budesonide for now and follow-up in 4 weeks. Reassess after third dose of Skyrizi with either fecal calprotectin or sigmoidoscopy. Risks and benefits of these treatments were reviewed as well as previous therapeutic failures
3. Constipation by delayed colonic transit - K59.01 Resume MiraLAX if necessary
4. Other specified counseling - Z71.89 - Continue yearly dermatologic and gynecologic screening. Hepatitis B surface antibody negative in 2023. Avoid live virus vaccination
5. Iron deficiency - E61.1 - Anemia has resolved as well as iron deficiency. Continue laboratory monitoring
6. History of tuberculosis exposure - Completed therapy in 2016 with clearance for biologic therapy thereafter.
7. GERD. Normal EGD in 2021. She reports previous allergy to pantoprazole. Recommend switching omeprazole to 30 minutes prior to the morning meal along with on-demand famotidine.
8. Personal history of sporadic adenoma. We discussed current guidelines regarding surveillance in the setting of a history of adenomatous polyps especially those removed by EMR technique. Repeat colonoscopy 3 years (2026)

History of Present Illness:
The patient reports ongoing episodes of diarrhea, which occur approximately once a month. The diarrhea is described as a ""purge,"" with the first bowel movement being a forceful flush, followed by three subsequent episodes of complete diarrhea. The patient notes that the diarrhea is black in color and occurs without warning, making it difficult to reach the bathroom in time and often resulting in soiled underwear. On days without diarrhea, bowel movements are normal in form and appearance. The patient has been taking Imodium every other day to manage symptoms and is concerned about the safety of this frequency. The patient is about a year and a half out from a colonoscopy, during which these symptoms were not present. There have been no recent changes in medication except for the continued use of meloxicam, which has been taken for a long time for knee pain following a knee replacement. The patient is unsure how much meloxicam helps with knee symptoms but feels unable to discontinue it. Previous stool studies, including tests for pancreatic enzyme insufficiency and bacterial overgrowth, were normal.

Patient is a 73-year-old gentleman with a history of recurrent C. difficile and ulcerative colitis who was last seen by Dr. Guirl in June 2025. Plan at the time was to continue budesonide for total of 3 months along with mesalamine. He does have an office visit with Dr. Guirl on 9/25/2025.
Patient presents today for a follow-up telemedicine visit accompanied by his wife. He complains of worsening difficulty swallowing over the past 6 weeks. Of note he does have a history of esophageal cancer and is in remission. He was on antibiotics for a foot infection and follows with an infectious disease PA Allison who reached out to Dr. Guirl regarding his dysphagia. Of note earlier in the month he did have thrush that he was treated for. This morning he attempted to eat a sandwich but then felt that it was getting stuck in his throat and he ended up coughing it up. He does have heartburn for which he takes esomeprazole 40 mg once a day in the evening.

Mrs. Murphy is a 68-year-old female who presents for follow-up evaluation up at the request of Dr Hunt for  history of GERD and family history of pancreatic cancer and fatty liver. Last seen in August 2024. Had MR abdomen with and without contrast MRCP 10/24/2024 no acute abnormality hepatic steatosis. Cysts in the liver. Gallbladder is normal. Pancreas normal
Pt states one brother was recently dx at age 59 with a liver mass stage 4 (unsure what the primary is) Also the other brother at age 65 was diagnosed with pancreatic CA in November 2024 and is s/p chemo and XRT and is not surgical.  Mom also had pancreatic cancer.
Has been having IBS and was having urgency and loose stools but was eating differently on vacation.
EGD 2/7/2024 showed irregular Z-line and small tongue of salmon-colored mucosa and biopsies were positive for Barrett's. H. pylori negative. After the EGD we continued omeprazole 40 mg once a day in the morning we added famotidine 40 mg at bedtime. She does have occasional left lower quadrant abdominal pain and Bentyl helps with the pain and taking it a couple times a day.
Has family history of 2 maternal aunts having colon cancer.
Was seen by ENT, Dr. Bergeron for chronic cough and felt to be due to LPR.

574,09-09-2025,689623,99214,K21.9,Z86.0100,,,"Chief Complaint:	This is a follow-up consultation for a 69-year-old female for management of gastroesophageal reflux disease and for surveillance colonoscopy.
History of Present Illness:
Rebecca is a 69-year-old female presenting for follow-up. She has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, esophageal stricture, and a history of an adenomatous polyp found on a previous colonoscopy.
Rebecca reports that her gastroesophageal reflux disease is well-controlled with Nexium 40 mg daily. She denies any heartburn issues. Her condition has also improved significantly with weight loss. She was diagnosed with prediabetes which progressed to diabetes. This motivated her to change her diet and mindset. Her physician, Dr. Grinsfelder, prescribed Ozempic, which has resulted in a weight loss of approximately 100 pounds. She reports feeling much better since losing weight. She reports loose skin as a consequence of the weight loss but has no plans for plastic surgery.
A previous colonoscopy performed in July 2020 by Dr. Stevens revealed a 5-millimeter adenomatous polyp, which was removed. A surveillance colonoscopy is therefore due in September 2025, five years after the initial finding. She has a history of esophageal stricture, with the last dilation performed in May 2021. Esophageal biopsies at that time were normal with no evidence of Barrett's esophagus. Her care was previously managed by Dr. Casey, then Dr. Stevens, before I assumed her care last year.
She has no questions regarding the upcoming colonoscopy. An upper endoscopy is not indicated at this time due to her well-controlled symptoms.

Diabetes mellitus type 2
History of esophageal stricture
Assessment:
- History of adenomatous colon polyp: A surveillance colonoscopy is due in September 2025, five years following the removal of a 5-millimeter adenomatous polyp in July 2020. The procedure was discussed, and she understands the indication for surveillance.
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease: Her symptoms are well-controlled on Nexium 40 mg daily. Significant weight loss has also contributed to symptom improvement. An upper endoscopy is not clinically indicated at this time.
- Weight loss: She has successfully lost approximately 100 pounds with diet, lifestyle changes, and the use of Ozempic for diabetes. This has had numerous health benefits, and she was praised for her efforts and positive mindset change. She has some residual loose skin but is not considering surgical intervention, and I have advised against it due to potential complications.
Plan:
Schedule surveillance colonoscopy for September 2025.
Continue Nexium 40 mg daily.
Continue current diet and lifestyle modifications for weight management and diabetes control.
I reviewed my overall clinical impression, diagnostic strategy and treatment plan with the patient at length. She voiced understanding.
Plan:	Adhere to lifestyle and dietary modifications for GERD diet as we discussed. This includes avoiding fatty and greasy foods, fried foods, tomato based foods, caffeine, carbonated drinks, coffee and alcohol. Elevate the head of your bed 6 inches. Additionally, do not eat or drink anything including water within two hours of going to bed at night or 10pm, whichever comes first. Recommend low fat, low cholesterol diet and exercise.
Low red meat, Low Fat, High Fiber Diet, with avoidance of processed foods
Avoid NSAIDs (Motrin, Advil, ibuprofen, Aleve, Naproxen, etc.)
Colonoscopy with Anesthesia Provider/CRNA who is hereby directed and authorized to administer anesthesia - 45378
Continue Nexium 40 mg daily, take 30 minutes before breakfast on empty stomach"

Belinda Hernandez is a 50 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit. She reports loose stools with a sense of urgency. She is currently taking fiber supplements to help with her bowel habits. She uses Advil as needed, about once a month. She notes that acidic foods trigger stomach upset and increased belching. Labs are negative for celiac disease inflammatory markers including CRP and ESR were negative. Food allergy panel was notable for slight antibodies to egg whites, shrimp and scallop.  Colonoscopy in 2022 was notable for serrated adenoma and otherwise unremarkable.

History of Present Illness:
David Dubuc is a 50 year old male who is seen today for a follow-up visit.He presents for routine follow-up after recent genetic testing as below. He had initial Lynch syndrome analysis at time of surgical resection and 2014 and DNA mismatch repair proteins for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 were positive indicating normal gene products. However, subsequent serologic testing showed an abnormality of the NTHL1 gene, and for this reason he presents for reevaluation. He is generally asymptomatic although does have occasional difficulty swallowing commensurate with history of eosinophilic esophagitis, but no solid food bolus impactions. There is no abdominal pain, hematochezia, or melena. Subsequent colonoscopic surveillance have shown adenomas on each subsequent exam. There is no family history of upper gastrointestinal, colorectal, or breast carcinoma. His first-degree family members have undergone screening, specifically siblings
He completed adjuvant systemic therapy with FOLFOX in 5/2015 and began a clinical trial evaluating regorafenib after completion of standard therapy but had difficulties with mucositis and pain and withdrew therapy in July 2015
Labs 2024-hematocrit 42, MCV 90, platelets 322, normal chemistries, normal hepatic enzymes, CEA 2.5. CTs have been unremarkable and no additional scans are recommended in the absence of symptoms
Lynch syndrome analysis 7/2025-pathogenic mutation p.Q90*/p.!90*consistent with pathogenic mutation of the NTHL1 gene. No additional pathogenic mutations or variants of unknown significance or gross deletions or duplications were detected. Current screening considerations include starting at age 25-30 with colonoscopy every 1 to 2 years if polyps are found
Cecal adenocarcinoma diagnosed 2014. Immunostain for DNA mismatch repair proteins MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 pos indicating normal gene products, speaking against MSI-related malignancy

Genetic predisposition to cancer
Dysphagia
Assessment:
We reviewed what is known about the NTHL1 gene mutation and potential association with early onset and polyposis syndrome. This is thought to be a rare, autosomal recessive condition resulting in greater risk for multiple cancers including colorectal and small intestinal tumors, affecting DNA repair leading to greater accumulation of mutations and tumor development. A wide range of cancers are potentially associated with these mutations including colorectal, breast, endometrial, brain, and spinal cord tumors. Surveillance is currently recommended every 2 years beginning at age 18. Endoscopy is recommended at least every 5 years beginning at age 25 as well as a brain MRI for meningioma at diagnosis with follow-up imaging in those with signs and/or symptoms of meningioma. As this is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, the assumption would be both of David's parents were probably heterozygous and his siblings would have a 50% chance of being a carrier and 25% chance of being affected as well as a 25% chance of having either.
In this setting, colonoscopic surveillance is recommended at 2-year intervals, along with upper endoscopy at time of next colonoscopy. I also encouraged screening by MRI given potential association with meningioma. He and his wife will also seek formal genetic counseling regarding her candidacy for testing as it may impact decisions regarding surveillance for their children.

Novella Lewis is a 89 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit for coli consult. Patient continues to report intermittent diarrhea with occasional fecal incontinence. She was having a difficult time reporting the extent of her loose bowel movements or incontinence. However, she reports that she can go up to 4 days or a week without any bowel movements, and then have days where she has 3-4 bowel movements with loose stools. She believes that she has the looser bowel movements up to 3 times a week. Patient was unable to report the frequency of incontinence, but states that she often will use the restroom and see which she stools in her undergarments without even knowing that she had fecal soilage. She also reports abdominal bloating and constant nausea x 6 months, but without vomiting. She is tolerating a normal diet and her weight has been stable. Patient states that she does take a stool softener as needed when she gets constipated, and is not utilizing Imodium. She has utilized Metamucil the past, but states this caused increase in bowel movements. Patient also denies melena, hematochezia, rectal pain, abdominal pain, vomiting, dysphagia, GERD sx, decreased appetite, unintentional weight loss, or night sweats. Patient now reports a history of partial colectomy secondary to diverticulitis over 20 years ago.

Assessment:
Novella Lewis is a pleasant 89-year-old female with a past medical history of GERD, chronic diarrhea, diverticular disease, colon polyps, HTN, CKD, and sleep apnea who presents to clinic for a follow up on fecal incontinence and chronic diarrhea along with personal history of colon polyps. Patient is under recall for surveillance colonoscopy due this year. She continues to report occasional fecal incontinence with intermittent loose bowel movements, which has been ongoing for several years.  Pt denies alarm features. She has had extensive evaluation to include stool studies, SIBO breath test, and colonoscopy that have been benign/negative. Therefore, I do continue to suspect that her loose bowel movements are likely functional in nature and incontinence is 2/2 pelvic floor dysfunction and poor anal sphincter tone as noted during previous evaluation. She has declined proceeding with further evaluation at the pelvic floor clinic due to location. Therefore, I recommend that she start soluble fiber (Banatrol) to help bulk up her stools, utilize Imodium as needed, and continue Kegel exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor. In regard to her being due for surveillance colonoscopy, we discussed the risks and benefits of proceeding with endoscopic evaluation given her age with evidence of only 1 small adenomatous polyp on colonoscopy 3 years ago. Patient preferred to hold off for now, but will discuss this again at follow-up. Patient expressed understanding and agreed with plan.
Plan:	Gradual titration of fiber supplementation discussed (Benefiber, Metamucil, Citrucel.)
Imodium A-D 2 mg Take 1 tablet by mouth daily as needed for diarrhea; Max 8tabs/day
Kegel exercises as recommended.
Follow-up office visit in 2 months

Assessment:
Hepatitis B: Most recent labs showed negative hepatitis B surface antigen, positive hepatitis B core antibody, negative hepatitis B surface antibody. Will continue to monitor Hep B DNA and ALT every 6 months.
Hepatic fibrosis: Given presence of hepatic fibrosis and longstanding hepatitis B, he needs ongoing radiographic surveillance with ultrasound and AFP every 6 months.
CRC screening: Given his age and results of last colonoscopy it is not mandatory that he undergo any further surveillance colonoscopies.
Hiatal hernia: I suspect this may be contributing to chronic cough, as there has been partial improvement with PPI twice daily. He may continue to use alginate's as needed after meals and at bedtime. If there is progression in symptoms, would consider surgical repair of the hiatal hernia. However per last visit, he has strong preference to avoid surgery at this time.

#Bloating
#Diarrhea, altered bowel habits
#BRBPR concern for internal hemorrhoids
--> Concern for IBS-D
Patient reports longstanding issues of dyspepsia, bloating, diarrhea, occasional constipation. Patient states that whenever she has a bowel movement, there is always mucus. Occasionally will have snakes in the stool and blood. No pain with defecation. Every other week, will have a day of 6 bowel movements per day. Bloating is exacerbated with food or liquid intake and lower abdominal distension. No dysphagia, nausea, vomiting. Weight has been stable. Reports early satiety. Has tried FODMAP diet in the past but was not effective. Does note strong gut brain connection with sx.
-Prior therapies: dicyclomine, omeprazole (ineffective)
OV 9/2025: Patient reports persistent symptoms of bloating, diarrhea (worsening), rectal bleeding. Is concerned for IBS vs IBD. Notes prior endoscopies with inflammation and is concerned this is evolving. She requests repeat endoscopy/colonoscopy. We discussed that there is low likelihood for new findings however given intermittent rectal bleeding, worsening diarrhea, repeat endoscopy is reasonable. We discussed that if endoscopies are unremarkable, would consider neuromodulator for diagnosis of IBS-D.

History of Present Illness:
Pamela Koenig is a 69 yo female w/ hx of GERD, IBS, arthritis, depression, hypothyroidism. Last seen in office 2/28/2025 for periumbilical/epigastric abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Recommended Abd US, EGD/flex sig, and rx'd a course of Xifaxan. She did not complete the Abd US or EGD/flex sig due to a death in the family, and a busy summer of traveling. She did, however, complete the course of Xifaxan.
She is here TODAY for follow up.
1. Abdominal pain
Intermittent daily periumbilical/epigastric abdominal pain/discomfort, has been ongoing for years now. Pain/discomfort usually occurs postprandially. Often associated with abdominal bloating/gas. Pain was occurring more frequently when she saw us in clinic in February this year, but she did not follow through with EGD or Abd US due to a death in her family, and a busy summer of traveling. Did not notice improvement with PPI. She has been following a low FODMAP diet, which helps some. She met with a functional nutritionist, and is happy with their recommendations. Has also tried Dicyclomine, which helps with the pain, but caused constipation so she stopped taking it.
2. Diarrhea / Constipation
Longstanding history of diarrhea for >15 years. At time of last OV, was having 3-6 loose/watery BMs before 1PM daily, which was occurring irrespective of food intake. Was also having bowel urgency and occasional FI. After last OV, she completed a course of Xifaxan which she states helped, but she has now become constipated. In June, she called our office and was recommended to take Miralax 255g in 64oz of water over two days. She did this, with good effect. Now has daily small BMs, usually Bristol type 2-3. Occasionally still has diarrhea with Bristol type 5 BMs, but infrequent. Currently not on a daily bowel regimen. Drinks adequate water. Tries to stay active. Admits to poor dietary fiber intake. Not on a fiber supplement.
3. GERD
Previously on Pantoprazole 40mg daily, but stopped after last OV because she didn't feel like it was helping her abdominal pain. Since stopping PPI, only has rare pyrosis, about every 3-4 weeks. States she belches frequently.

History of Present Illness:
59-year-old male with a personal history of colon polyps following up today in office to discuss surveillance colonoscopy. He underwent his previous scope in 2022 with removal of multiple adenomas. Follow-up was recommended in 3 years.
Over the past couple of years, the patient has continued to experience fecal soiling from a known perianal fistula. He underwent fistulotomy with Dr. Lewis a few years ago, but unfortunately symptoms persisted. Most recently, he has been seen by Dr. Jackson who performed a procedure with cautery to try and close the fistula that did not improve his symptoms. He does report less soiling and drainage through the fistula with fiber supplementation. Additionally, the patient has been experiencing infraumbilical abdominal discomfort and bloating. The symptoms have improved to some degree as well with fiber supplementation.

We discussed further diagnostic and management options for the various potential causes. Further diagnostic testing includes laboratory testing, imaging, and endoscopy. Will order lipase and amylase as she is concerned about her pancreas. Will also order an abdominal ultrasound.
2. Anemia: Her labs done at her PCP's office showed mild anemia hgb 10.2, MCV slightly low at 79.3 with normal RDW. She was instructed to start iron supplements. I advised her to hold on starting iron supplements for now until we obtain iron studies due to concerns for liver injury. She did have her menses that lasted 30 days, with heavy bleeding in May 2025, and was seen by her OBGYN in which she as advised to have an endometrial bx vs ablation depending on the characteristics of her next menses. She had a high quality CSP in 11/2024 as noted above. We discussed obtaining EGD due to her epigastric pain and bloating. Will reassess her labs today.

History of Present Illness:
Carolyn Marlar is an 82-year-old female with a past medical history of A-fib, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, history of pacemaker placement who presents for evaluation for diarrhea. She was in her usual state of health until she received a course of amoxicillin for a dental issue. Since that time, she has been having issues with diarrhea. It started off more significant but now it is down to about twice daily. She denies any bleeding. She has been trying to limit her diet to a certain degree to help with the diarrhea but she does not necessarily endorse a decreased appetite. She has taken some Imodium without significant improvement. She had also been given a course of vancomycin and which did help a little bit but not completely. She does have a family history of diverticulitis in her maternal grandmother. She has had an appendectomy in the past.

Assessment:
Carolyn Marlar is an 82-year-old female with a past medical history of A-fib, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, history of pacemaker placement who presents for evaluation for diarrhea. Overall, I think her diarrhea is likely related to post antibiotic diarrhea/SIBO. Will go ahead and start with some basic stool tests to rule out any sort of infection. If the stool tests are negative, we can always consider a course of Xifaxan to see if it helps. If she continues to have diarrhea despite that, we can always consider a colonoscopy. In the meantime, I told her that she can use Imodium for the diarrhea if needed.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. Casillas is an 81 year old patient who presents for a follow up evaluation.
Last Visit 6/25/2025: Hx SB carcinoid, s/p exlap w/ SB resection/end-to-end anastomosis 10/2014. Hx of recurrent SBO requiring exploratory laparotomy and lysis of adhesions at least 2-3x since initial exlap 2014.
-Recently hospitalized for another SBO, treated conservatively.
-- CT abdomen/pelvis w/ IV cont 6/5/25: SBO. WBC 11.4 (H), Hgb 13.5, GFR 57, LFTs WNL. 6/10/25 Normal SB follow through.
CC: Constant LUQ abdominal pain, 3/10, exacerbated by stress, with associated intermittent nausea, sometimes with vomiting, x past few months. Does not feel these are the same symptoms she has had chronically.
--> Recommend EGD, GES
-EGD 8/19/2025: 2cm hiatal hernia. LA Class B esophagitis, and Irregular squamocolumnar junction in the esophagus, biopsies with mild reflux esophagitis,  and mild nonspecific chronic inflammation at SCJ. Erosive duodenitis, neg H pylori/Celiac disease.
-7/29/2025 - Gastric Emptying Mod Meal Solid - Delayed gastric emptying at 1 hour, 72%, normalizes by 4 hours, 1% retention.
Today,
- Pleased with her response to starting Omeprazole s/p EGD Aug. Prior nausea/vomiting has improved.
- Can still get LUQ pain, as previously discussed, but it is less frequent since starting Omeprazole 40 mg.
-- LUQ pain is unrelated to eating. Randomly occurring, associated upper abdominal bloating.
-- Her son, who accompanies patient today, notes she does drink a lot of sparkling water. She doesn't like water otherwise.
- Now, her chief concern has moved to lower abdominal pain/cramping associated with bowel movements, though notes the cramping occurs after defecation, not before.
- Occurring every day, after her daily BM.
- Typically having a BM daily, consistency can vary from normal to diarrhea.
-- Believes diarrhea is not related to a specific trigger food, as she eats largely the same diet daily.
- Hyoscyamine does usually help eventually ease the pain/cramping, but not always. Then has to use Tramadol for pain.
-- Infrequent use of the Tramadol. One tab every few days.
- Anxious about the lower abdominal pain, and requests a colonoscopy. Has had recent abdominal imaging, with no specific findings to explain the pain (completed at ED for SBO.)
-Denies blood in the stool, melena.
-Has lost 8lb since last visit; attributes to improved diet, eating less sugar and carbohydrates.
** History **
- NEMH - CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast 9/25/2024: mild colitis. Treated with abx.

Assessment:
Prior chief complaints of nausea/vomiting and LUQ pain have significantly improved s/p starting omeprazole 40 mg daily after August EGD, showing LA class B esophagitis, biopsies with mild reflux and nonspecific esophagitis, and erosive duodenitis.
-LUQ associated with upper abdominal bloating, and her son notes that she does drink a lot of sparkling water.
Given her improvement on omeprazole, recommend she use famotidine 40 mg as needed when she has the intermittent left upper pain.
--If famotidine improves her pain, can discuss possible change in therapy from PPI to PCAB.
--If no improvement with the famotidine, would recommend closer monitoring for potential triggers, such as keeping a log, and avoiding carbonated beverages.
Chief concern is now post defecation lower abdominal pain/cramping, occurring daily after her bowel movement, which varies in consistency from normal to diarrhea.
-Hyoscyamine typically helpful and eventually easing symptoms, though occasionally needs to use tramadol if pain is not improved with the hyoscyamine.
-Does have anxiety about the lower abdominal pain and requests colonoscopy.
--S/p recent abdominal imaging with no specific findings to explain her abdominal cramping pain, though may be related to her known adhesive disease.
--Last colonoscopy completed in 2020, and her abdominal pain and cramping symptoms have been chronic, so do recommend proceeding with colonoscopy.
-Also recommend taking hyoscyamine, 2 tablets once daily 30 to 60 minutes before she typically has her daily bowel movement, which is consistently around 10 AM in the morning, to help prevent/limit developing the cramping pain in the first place.
Time spent in counseling and/or coordination of care (including but not limited to reviewing prior records, arranging further services, communicating further with other care providers) was at least 55 minutes with more than 50% of this time spent in face-to-face or direct telecommunication with the patient.

History of Present Illness:
Very pleasant 73-year-old gentleman here today for consultation regarding bloating. Also apparently recently was hospitalized with acute pancreatitis. Unknown exactly what the etiology was though they thought it may be diet related. He denies that he was told he needed his gallbladder out or that there were any gallstones. He responded well after about 3 days and was discharged home. He has never had pancreatitis before. He does have a history of RA and type 2 diabetes. Since that time and perhaps even a little bit before he is endorsing abdominal bloating. He is trying to avoid certain foods such as onion and spicy foods and this has helped. Plan to be harder to but insurance will for tighter when he is bloated and he will pass excessive flatus. Denies any blood in the stool. His last colonoscopy was over 10 years ago. He has never had an endoscopy before. He does have a prior history of CABG April 2024. He is on Plavix.

Assessment:
Need to request records from the hospital to see more information about his pancreatitis. I am unsure how much of the bloating and symptoms are related to that versus luminal pathologies. I do think endoscopy is warranted given his symptoms. I will check a lipase today including triglyceride levels and request the records from the hospital. He is also due for an average risk screening colonoscopy which we will perform at time of the endoscopy. We discussed a low FODMAP diet to help with the bloating in the interim. I will request clearance from his cardiologist given his history of CABG last year and the fact that he is on Plavix. Patient is agreeable to this plan and we will schedule a clinic follow-up in 3 months.

Assessment:
I reviewed the patient's medical history at length with him and discussed the risk and benefits of a colonoscopy. We discussed current guidelines regarding colon cancer screening. After reviewing the risk I think it would be advisable to not proceed to colonoscopy at this point. He is asymptomatic and has no significant family history and in addition has a significant cardiac and pulmonary history that seem to outweigh the risk of the colonoscopy. Obviously of his clinical condition should change from a gastrointestinal standpoint we will certainly reconsider. He was appreciative of this discussion and will notify me if any changes in his clinical status which may suggest the need for reevaluation

He does have heartburn for which he is on pantoprazole daily. About a month ago he had some blood in his stool which is since resolved. He does have some dysphagia to solid food which seem to improve with PPI therapy as well. Patient last had a colonoscopy in 2020 per his history and has a history of diverticulosis. Laboratory studies in March 2025 showed a normal CBC, CMP, vitamin B12 and vitamin D level. Patient still has a gallbladder intact as well. Plan was to check abdominal ultrasound and an upper endoscopy. EGD was notable for mild reflux esophagitis, H. pylori, EOE negative. Plan was to minimize NSAIDs and a trial of pantoprazole 40 mg daily and office visit in 6 weeks to see how he is doing. As he has been on that for months, he was switched to Nexium 40 mg daily with a plan to take it 30 to 60 minutes before breakfast. Abdominal ultrasound was normal.
Patient presents today for follow-up visit. Since he was last seen, he has been taking Nexium 40 mg daily and his symptoms of epigastric abdominal pain have resolved. He does report some occasional reflux and heartburn. He denies any issues with dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, gas or bloating, changes in bowel habits, blood in his stool, melena, unintentional weight loss or fevers.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. Susie Atchison is a 73-year-old female who presents for a follow-up evaluation for lower abdominal pain with constipation. Also with NAFLD. Last seen in December 2024 for EGD/colonoscopy.
Patient states she does have occasional left lower quadrant tenderness but having a bowel movement makes her pain better. Uses hyoscyamine as needed but not very often. Having more constipation and taking MiraLAX a couple times a week. Does not always schedule it. States she is having a bowel movement daily but it is very small. Feels like her stools are ""slowing down"". Her nausea is good and no longer needing medications. Denies any reflux symptoms. Try stopping drinking Diet Coke because she feels that is causing increased gas. Does drink about a can a day and has been off of it for about a week. States she had labs done by her endocrinologist

Assessment:
Has history of left lower quadrant abdominal pain that improves with bowel movement. Feel this is probably due to IBS constipation. Will try to control her constipation and we will give her hyoscyamine to take as needed.
Constipation KUB in November 2024 showed moderate to large colonic stool burden. Will have her continue MiraLAX and would have her schedule it and would take it daily until her stools improve and then can take half a cap to a full cap every other day to prevent any diarrhea but have good stools.
Fatty liver. Had FibroScan done in April 2024 that showed fatty liver and possible mild scarring. Her LFTs are within normal limits and labs from November 2024 showed alk phos 134 AST 13 ALT 12. Discussed about doing an MR elastography of the liver but she is claustrophobic and have to be sedated. Will repeat her FibroScan at this time I will obtain labs from Quest will notify her of the results

Diagnosis:	GERD (e)
Common bile duct dilatation
Assessment:
Epigastric pain-nonspecific & improved over time. Again, further recommendations pending results of below imaging.
Dilated common bile duct-differential diagnosis and diagnostic evaluation was reviewed. These are common in the postcholecystectomy state, and also are more significantly dilated with age as well. The possibility of a distal obstruction cannot fully be excluded, but again is not likely based on the normal hepatic enzymes and atypical nature of her pain. However, it cannot fully be excluded without dedicated imaging, and after extensive discussion today, it remains her strong desire to proceed especially given lack of clarity as to etiology for her pain and described abnormality of a liver process by imaging in the past. The rationale and risks and benefits were discussed and she agrees to proceed. We will perform MRCP without contrast to better delineate.
GERD-longstanding, with episodic symptoms which are not particular problematic to her at this time. No mandate for specific therapy unless there is no clear etiology based on results above

Dysphagia (e)
GERD without esophagitis
Assessment:
Ms. Romo is an 83-year-old female presenting for follow up of dysphagia and hiatal hernia.
Patient is doing well at today's visit after endoscopy with dilation back in April. She reports fewer dysphagia symptoms since her dilation. I advised that we could always repeat endoscopy with dilation should her dysphagia symptoms or recur. We additionally discussed the nature of her large hiatal hernia but that she is largely not symptomatic of this. There is consideration past for surgical referral but was ultimately deferred due to advanced age and relative lack of clinical symptoms.
Plan:	Continue current Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) as instructed.

Diarrhea: Nonbloody daytime mostly, likely related to food intolerance. A colonoscopy will be done to assess for gross or microscopic colitis.
Abnormal LFTs, mostly hepatocellular pattern with AST 59, ALT 40. Abdominal sonogram will be done to assess for biliary ductal abnormalities. She did have an echogenic liver likely due to fatty infiltration in 2019. The FibroScan may be a next step.
3/19/25 US abdomen: generalized fatty infiltration liver, 1 cm hypoechoic nodular area in the central aspect of the left lobe of the liver. Given the imaging findings and lack of any previous studies, consider follow-up liver ultrasound in 3-6 months to document stability of findings Otherwise unremarkable ultrasound abdomen

Follow up CT liver 4 phase with steatotic liver disease without splenomegaly, no evidence of a primary hepatic neoplasm, inflow and outflow vessels to the liver are patent. Will check follow up labs.
We discussed the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of fatty liver disease. Risk factors include elevated BMI, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes but also highlighting that it is a diagnosis of exclusion. We discussed the spectrum of fatty liver and potential progression to cirrhosis as well as the potential complications of cirrhosis, but provided reassurance that this change occurs over time. I recommended abstinence from alcohol, and to pursue diet, exercise, and weight loss with a goal to lose at least 7-10% of body weight to help reverse steatosis and early fibrotic changes. We discussed the recent benefits found to be related to Mediterranean diet in the setting of fatty liver.

History of Present Illness:
Regina Walker is a 62 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit.  with PMhx of CCY (2005), Roux-En-Y (2006), RA
This is a patient we see for elevated LFTs, constipation and GERD. Has family history with her maternal grandmother having colon cancer but no first degree relative. Dad had pancreatic cancer but no other family member. Last seen may 2025 by me.
GERD managed with Omeprazole 40 mg in the morning with Famotidine 40 mg at bedtime. Constipation managed with taking magnesium daily and MiraLAX a couple times a week and having a bowel movement daily.
Has been having elevated liver enzymes and her rheumatologist, Dr. Jose Roldan was considering starting her on methotrexate but concerned about her history of elevated LFTs. They did lower her Plaquenil since she lost weight but still having increased symptoms of her joint pain. Noted labs November 8, 2024 showed ALT of 254, AST of 107, alk phos of 101. MR elastography April 30, 2024 was normal. Still on Ozempic for her A1c (did briefly stop taking it at one point).
Was initially referred to see us in June 2012 when her labs from April 2012 showed an ALT of 102, AST 41. Labs June 2012 with ALT 57, AST 46.  Had a Liver biopsy 12/18/2012 showed mild portal triaditis with occasional eosinophils; mild increased iron deposits; fibrosis absent. Serological workup June 2012 with ANA, ASMA and AMA negative, alpha 1 antitrypsin normal at 123, ceruloplasmin normal 34, iron 83 with 21% sat, ferritin 23, LK M1 antibody normal, hepatitis B and hepatitis C negative. ALT was 57, AST was 46, ALP was 90, T. bili 0.3. Labs from November 2012 with ALT 143, AST 57, ALP 72, T. bili 0.3, celiac screening panel is negative.   CMV IgM and IgG antibodies and PCR negative July 2014. GGT normal March 2017.
Had a history of encephalitis from a virus and has had headaches and problems sleeping since then. Has been seen by endocrinologist Dr. Welch for elevated HgA1C and thyroid issues. Saw Dr.  Scott Ulmer (Hematologist) for her ITP and is in remission.
We referred her back to Methodist Hospital Liver Specialty and Transplant for her ongoing elevated liver enzymes. Labs 3/6/2025: WBC 4.3, hemoglobin 12 with MCV 78.1, platelets 220 ALT 151, AST 59, ALP 69, T. bili 0.4, BUN 13, creatinine 0.84. Iron 86, ferritin 13.3, iron sat 23%, vitamin B12 level 977. Receiving IV iron (Monoferric)
Dr. Safdar liver transplant recommendations were blood work to r/o chronic liver dz, MRCP with secretin to r/o functional obstruction of bile duct, and rec control of HLD.   We obtained a copy of the blood work they ordered. Labs 2/11/2025: ANA negative, AMA negative, ASMA negative, hepatitis A total antibody reactive with IgM antibody nonreactive. Hepatitis B surface antibody and core antibody nonreactive, hepatitis B surface antigen nonreactive, hepatitis C antibody nonreactive, AFP normal 5.4. Ceruloplasmin normal 31, IgG normal at 1186, alpha 1 antitrypsin normal 120. Alpha-1 phenotype MM. ALT 134, AST 88, ALP 65, T. bili 0.4.  WBC 5.5, hemoglobin 11.9 with MCV 73.9, hematocrit 36%, platelets 241, iron 151, ferritin 14, iron sat 39%, INR 1
At time of May 2025 visit, noted her Plaquenil dose was lowered and is doing 1.5 pill every other day, 1 pill on the days in between (before was doing 2 pills every day (400mg) daily). Has only ever been on Plaquenil and has been on this since November 2019. She noted some worsening of GERD symptoms and was taking Pepto along with her PPI and H2B. Did advise her to increase PPI to BID for 8 weeks to see if this helped and continue H2B. Gaviscon prn for breakthrough. Advised Miralax 1 capful daily + Benefiber
Currently, patient reports has not been able to see MSTH as they cancelled her appt and need to reschedule her, they did not have a provider available to see her.   Is now doing Plaquenil 1 pill once on Sunday and the other days does 1.5 pills the other 6 days.  Is noticing more arthritis with the lower dose.
May 31st labs with endocrinologist AST 67, ALT 160, A1C 5.8%, VitD level 74, BUN 13, Cr 0.82, Cholesterol 212, TG 54, LDL 86
Did receive an IV iron recently for low iron levels, has been intermittent issue since her gastric bypass in 2006
Is having issues with bloating, almost on a daily basis. Wakes up with flat stomach but then starts bloating after she eats. Does note that stomach gets upset when she eats something spicy and will drink carbonated beverage.  Mostly has BM once a day and takes miralax and Benefiber.

Bloating (abdominal)
Assessment:
62 year old female here in follow up for elevated LFTs.  Also with GERD and bloating.
LFTs have been elevated since at least 2012 and she's had serological workup that was negative, and liver bx 12/18/2012 showed mild portal triaditis with occasional eosinophils; mild increased iron deposits; fibrosis absent. Serological workup June 2012 with ANA, ASMA and AMA negative, alpha 1 antitrypsin normal at 123, ceruloplasmin normal 34, iron 83 with 21% sat, ferritin 23, LK M1 antibody normal, hepatitis B and hepatitis C negative.  November 2012 had negative celiac screening panel.   CMV IgM and IgG antibodies and PCR negative July 2014. GGT normal March 2017.   Noted she did not start on Plaquenil until 2019.  Only medication that she was on in 2012 and still on is Topamax and Synthroid.  Topamax has less than 1% chance of causing elevated LFTs and considered class C for liver tox, so very unlikely to be the culprit.
MR elastography April 30, 2024 was normal. We did refer her to Methodise Liver Transplant for second opinion and they did blood work with serological test February 2025 negative.  They did recommended MRCP with secretin which she has not heard back about scheduling that yet. She was supposed to see them in May but they cancelled her appt and rescheduled for August and then recently cancelled her appt again and have not rescheduled her yet.   Encouraged her to contact them next week if she has not heard from them by then.  Recent LFTs from May with AST 67, ALT 160.  Would like MSTH input if they think she needs repeat liver bx or not, she is also still waiting to hear back about scheduling the MRCP with secretin.
GERD -- is managed with  Omeprazole 40mg and Famotidine 40mg. Is on Ozempic which can worsen reflux.  May use OTC Gaviscon as needed.
Constipation --was having small, hard pellet stools. Advised to continue Benefiber daily and to increase her Miralax from 1/2 capful to 1 capful daily. Noted Ozempic can worsen constipation.Is presently doing better with Miralax and Benefiber.
Bloating -- having some increased bloating/gas, seems mostly related to mealtime.  D/w patient Low FODMAP diet and if that does not improve her symptoms then would recommend H+ breath test for SIBO evaluation and labs to screen for celiac since its been 13 years since last.
Plan:	Low FODMAP diet
Follow-up office visit in 4 months
Additional Notes:	--please be sure to get back in touch with Methodist Liver Transplant center, if you are unable to see them back then let us know and we can do referral to Texas Liver Institute
--Low FODMAP diet handout. If bloating does not improve then would look into doing blood work to screen for celiac disease (autoimmune allergy to gluten) and then also breath test for SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth)"

History of Present Illness:
Nancy Walker is a 66 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit.
Patient was last seen September 2022 for left lower quadrant abdominal pain. At that time she reported 2 months of intermittent left lower quadrant pain that starts off gradually and ends up in excruciating pain that last 2 to 3 minutes and then stops. Reported 25 pounds of unintentional weight loss. Noted her GERD was under good control with Nexium 20 mg in the morning. Reported 1 bowel movement per week and stated this is her normal baseline. Reported that fiber supplements worsen her symptoms. Underwent EGD/colonoscopy 10/27/2022: EGD with findings of localized irregular margins of erythema in the GE junction, 8 cm hiatal hernia noted, gastritis with biopsy negative for H. pylori, normal duodenum. Colon with mild diverticulosis throughout the colon, 8 mm SSA polyp in the ascending colon, internal hemorrhoids.
Patient called our office in August reporting abdominal pain and diarrhea as well as vomiting. She had gone to the ER and was diagnosed with colitis on CT scan. Reviewed her outside records. Was seen at North Central Baptist ER 8/18/2025 symptoms occurred after eating a fast food salad. CT abdomen pelvis with contrast shows a moderate size hiatal hernia with reflux of the fluid in the esophagus. Simple appearing hepatic cysts diffusely thickened hyperemic colonic and rectal mucosa consistent with diffuse proctocolitis. Was given Bentyl and Zofran. Labs showed a white count of 5.8 H&H is 15.1 and 43 platelet count is 245 albumin 4.3 alk phos 66 AST 10 ALT 7.
We did offer stool studies but patient declined, stating diarrhea had subsided.  We did have great difficulty getting in touch with patient as our calls to her would go straight to her voice mail and we would leave a message to call us back but she stated she never received the missed calls or voicemails.  We told her we felt she likely has a spam blocker on her phone that may be blocking calls from phone numbers that she does not have saved in her contacts.  She later saved our office phone number to her contacts and then was able to start receiving our phone calls.
Noted, had some difficulty obtaining history from patient, unable to give clear answers to my specific questions.
Currently, patient reports that the ER note neglected to note that she was in excruciating abdominal pain for 4 days and that she was having explosive diarrhea and uncontrollable. Said had waited 4 days before going to the ER because she thought she would eventually get better.  Says they had a hard time getting an IV line in her in the ER because she was so dehydrated, despite multiple attemps by various staff. Says eventually the last person pierced through her vein and has a large bruise and swelling still and did see her PCP for this yesterday. She did take the Bentyl and Zofran, says it helped some.  Says eating bland food and even drinking water causes cramping, but they are less excruciating than before.  Says had 1 BM with a stool that had a white streak and had some stools with mucus.  Has not seen any further stools with white in them.  Reports sensation she needs to have a BM but does not pass anything.  Reports bloating.  Reports dull nausea and uncomfortable feeling below her belly button and across her abdomen. Reports 2 stools that were ""like balls"" that she had yesterday and the day before. Says the stools were hard firm and dry and required effort to get them out. Says baseline BM is constipation and does not typically have a daily BM.   Says a month or so ago had ""something like this"" but the pain was not as intense and had seen her PCP and by the time she got to her PCP the pain was pretty much gone, had only lasted about 2 days.
Says had brain injury in 2011 and uses a cane to help get around
Review of records:
--Colonoscopy 7/16/2012 showed 10 cm of acute proctitis and biopsy showed just acute erosive proctitis but did not look chronic. Also had a few diverticuli but no polyps. Reviewed with pathologist and looks acute process. Bx with mild acute erosive proctitis.
--EGD March 5, 2013 showed a 5 cm hiatal hernia was noted (32-37 cm). At the GEJ was a shallow 8 mm ulceration c/w ulcerative esophagitis. No stricture or narrowing was noted in the esophagus however the esophagus appeared torturous. Gastric erythema was seen in the gastric body and antrum. Biopsies were negative for Helicobacter pylori. A lap band was noted in the fundus of the stomach.
--EGD/colonoscopy 10/27/2022: EGD with findings of localized irregular margins of erythema in the GE junction, 8 cm hiatal hernia noted, gastritis with biopsy negative for H. pylori, normal duodenum. Colon with mild diverticulosis throughout the colon, 8 mm SSA polyp in the ascending colon, internal hemorrhoids.
--CT abdomen pelvis with contrast 8/18/2025: shows a moderate size hiatal hernia with reflux of the fluid in the esophagus. Simple appearing hepatic cysts diffusely thickened hyperemic colonic and rectal mucosa consistent with diffuse proctocolitis.

Assessment:
66-year-old female presents via televisit in follow-up from an ER visit she had 8/18/2025 at North Central Baptist for abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Her CT scan showed diffusely thickened hyperemic colonic and rectal mucosa consistent with diffuse proctocolitis. Her symptoms have been present for 4 days at the time of her ER presentation. She was sent home with prescription for Bentyl and Zofran. She notes some improvement in her symptoms but still overall does not feel back to normal and is seeing mucus in her stools and still with dull abdominal pain and bloating. Her last colonoscopy was in October 2022 with an 8 mm SSA polyp in the ascending colon.
Given that she is still having symptoms we will proceed with a colonoscopy to evaluate for any evidence of an inflammatory bowel disease or alternative etiology. Patient does not want to complete stool studies at this time. Will prescribe dicyclomine 10 mg every 4-6 hours as needed for her abdominal cramping. Cautioned her on side effect of constipation. She will need to hold her Mounjaro prior to her colonoscopy. She can continue on a soft and bland diet for now. She can also try over-the-counter Prevacid for her heartburn since she cannot find Nexium tablets anymore.
Plan:	Colonoscopy with Anesthesia Provider/CRNA who is hereby directed and authorized to administer anesthesia - 45378
ondansetron 4 mg Dissolve 1 tablet by mouth 30 min prior to each prep for nausea and vomiting
Follow-up office visit in 4 months
She is unsure if her insurance will cover any prescription bowel preps. Has done GoLytely prep in the past
dicyclomine 10 mg Take 1 capsule by mouth every four to six hours prn for abdominal cramping
Additional Notes:	--Can try OTC Prevacid (Lansoprazole) tablets since you are having hard time finding in stock supply of Nexium tablets
--WIll need to hold the Mounjaro prior to the colonoscopy bowel prep
--Soft and bland diet for now
--May use Dicyclomine 10mg as needed for abdominal cramping"

History of Present Illness:
Issac Prieto is a 40 year old male who is seen today for a follow-up visit on his reflux. He admits that the Voquezna works much better than the rabeprazole but he has had some recurrence in his chest pain/heartburn, regurgitation, and bloating. He admits though he missed his dose for over a week and this seemed to retrigger his symptoms. He admits sometimes he feels ""like it takes his breath away"". He has had a stress test and check up with cardiology which was benign. He also admits to some foreign body sensation ""feels like a ball is in his throat"" but this has only happened a couple of times.

Retained fluid in stomach
Assessment:
Issac is a pleasant 40 year old male with PMH including anxiety who presents via telemedicine follow up of his reflux. We reviewed his good response to Voquezna initially though after missing this for a little over a week his symptoms did recur and worsen. Despite resuming his Voquezna at 10 mg he does continue with symptoms particularly with pyrosis, regurgitation, and bloating. I did recommend he add on famotidine to his Voquezna dose and proceed with the gastric emptying scan previously ordered due to retained fluid in his stomach on his EGD. He did admit that he was having some difficulties with affording this earlier in the year. So, we will go ahead and have him try a gastroparesis friendly diet in the interim with a handout provided. I do suspect there may be an anxiety component as well worsening his symptoms leading to the ""taking his breath away"", etc. Also, he has been evaluated by cardiology with a benign stress test reportedly.

History of Present Illness:
Andrea Moore is a 71 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit.   She presents for follow-up visit to discuss recent bout of left lower quadrant pain. She is concerned that she may have had a recurrent diverticulitis flare. She did undergo CT scan with PCP recently which showed evidence of mild focal fat stranding in the diverticula in the mid to proximal transverse colon however cannot exclude mild diverticulitis. Since undergoing the CT scan, she notes near resolution in left lower quadrant discomfort. She reports left lower quadrant pain does occur intermittently and she describes a throbbing pain.. She did undergo sigmoidectomy in 2024 given history of chronic smoldering diverticulitis. Again, currently she reports resolution in symptoms which led to the CT scan. She occasionally experiences constipation, but reports this is mild. There is no hematochezia or melena. She denies any fevers, nausea, vomiting.
CT scan 2025: mild focal fat stranding iin the diverticula mid to proximal transverse colon, can not exclude mild diverticulitis
She recently hospitalized for complicated diverticulitis, which was identified based upon a CT scan performed in the presence of mild abdominal cramping. She denied fevers preceding this and had not been on steroids or other immunosuppressive agents. She was hospitalized for percutaneous drainage and administration of IV antibiotics and has had prompt and near complete resolution of symptoms.

Assessment:
Left lower quadrant pain: Differential diagnosis and diagnostic evaluation discussed with patient. We did review recent CT scan which showed possible mild diverticulitis. Since undergoing CT scan, symptoms have completely resolved and therefore no further workup or treatment is needed. I suspect occasional discomfort is related to history of smoldering diverticulitis and recent sigmoidectomy. I do recommend fiber supplementation or possibly trial of MiraLAX as she does note occasional constipation. If pain recurs, she will contact our office for further evaluation.
History of smoldering diverticulitis: She underwent sigmoidectomy in 2024 with Dr. Winston.
GERD: Seems to be well-controlled PPI therapy. I do recommend titration to lowest therapeutic dose.
Hepatic steatosis noted on recent CT scan: Recommend fibroscan to delineate the degree of steatosis and fibrosis.

#LUQ abdominal/flank pain with radiation to pelvis
#Nausea, bloating, early satiety
#Unintentional weight loss
Presentation 7/2025: Patient reports severe abdominal bloating, pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and diarrhea for the past two months. The symptoms began suddenly without any known trigger. The pain was predominantly on the right side and the entire abdomen was tender and sore. The patient reported episodes of constipation lasting seven to ten days, interspersed with diarrhea. Despite the use of Miralax, Milk of Magnesia, and stool softeners, the patient continued to struggle with bowel movements, which were infrequent and involved passing thin stools. The patient visited the emergency room four times, where CT scans indicated constipation. Previous medical advice included the use of daily Miralax leading up to a planned colonoscopy. The patient also expressed concern about potential endometriosis affecting the bowel, especially since a history of early-stage endometriosis was noted during a prior hysterectomy.
OV 9/2025: Differential includes intussusception, autoimmune disease, systemic pathology such as vasculitis/lupus, primary gastric disorder such as PUD. EGD indicated for unintentional weight loss >10% TBWL in 6 months, early satiety, bloating. Rest of workup below.

Assessment:
Had extensive discussion with patient about management of H. pylori gastritis. Orders were placed for spouse as we see her in the office. Patient will await results of spouse and initiate treatment at the same time with spouse if positive. Patient understands that he should do H. pylori breath test 4 weeks after finishing treatment
Screening colon cancer: Will be due for screening colonoscopy in 2 to 3 years. Referral in place. Will obtain records from prior surgeon who performed most recent colonoscopy.
GERD/dysphagia: After H. pylori breath test has been completed patient can restart PPI therapy. GERD lifestyle modifications
Plan:	Colonoscopy in 2 years
My office will obtain records from Dr. Alcantera referring physician

History of Present Illness:
Heriberto Reynolds is a 60 year old male who is seen today for a annual visit for management of GERD. He continues taking pantoprazole 40 mg daily without complaints. There is no dysphagia, odynophagia, unintentional weight loss. Overall, this dose seems to manage reflux symptoms, there is occasional exacerbations, typically related to dietary indiscretion. But again, there have been no alarm symptoms over time. He has history of gastric sleeve in 2012 for which she does take multivitamin 4. There is no change in bowel habits, hematochezia, melena. Last EGD was from 2015 and showed evidence of class B esophagitis, 4 cm hiatal hernia. Last colonoscopy was in 2021, detailed below.
He was previously hospitalized briefly while traveling in Boston, because of low back and chest discomfort. Workup showed a fluid-filled esophagus, with hiatal hernia, and he subsequently had laboratory workup that was otherwise unremarkable and was referred back for evaluation. Following this the endoscopy, as noted below, showed evidence of grade B esophagitis and a 4 cm hiatal hernia, which was not present several years ago. After continued use of Protonix, once daily, his symptoms responded entirely
EGD 2012-performed because of suggestion of a previous gastric polyp, not identified, but there was evidence of mild peptic esophagitis with H. pylori negative gastropathy
Barium swallow 6/2017-normal esophagus with normal peristalsis, small sliding hiatal hernia, similar in appearance to previous study, with several episodes of small-volume spontaneous reflux
EGD 11/2015-Los Angeles grade B erosive esophagitis, 4 cm hiatal hernia, otherwise normal post-sleeve gastrectomy endoscopy
Colonoscopy 11/2015-normal
Ultrasound 11/2015-normal
Records from hospitalization in Boston 11/2015-normal chemistries, normal hepatic profile, alcohol and phosphatase 136, normal cardiac enzymes, normal CBC with hematocrit 43.1 and MCV 87, CT showing hiatal hernia with fluid-filled esophagus but no other acute abnormality.

Hiatal hernia
History of sleeve gastrectomy
Assessment:
GERD with history of Class B Esophagitis, 4 cm hiatal hernia: We again discussed the pathophysiology, natural history, and treatments of hiatal hernias. The cornerstone of therapy for those with mild to moderate symptoms remains conservative, with dietary modification, weight loss, and PPI therapy, titrating to lowest therapeutic dose. Surgery may be considered for large hernias or those which do not respond to conservative measures. In this case, he is stable on current dose and therefore see no reason to make any changes. He may add in h2 antagonist or alginate as needed for breakthrough symptoms.
History of Gastrectomy: Again encouraged a bariatric multivitamin. Routine laboratory testing to assess for deficiencies of vitamins, B12, folic acid, iron, vitamin D, calcium, fat-soluble vitamins, zinc, and copper, should be performed annually. Will order labs today.
Repeat screening colonoscopy suggested for 2031.

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 55-year-old gentleman who was last seen in August 2023. We received records that he had recent labs done in July 2025 for CMP and CBC which was notable for AST of 38 and ALT of 61, rest of his labs within normal limits. This is significantly improved from his labs from August 2023 which showed AST 49 and ALT 115.
Patient presents today for follow-up visit to review his lab results. He reports feeling well overall. He is currently on lansoprazole 15 mg daily with good control of his GERD symptoms. If he does not take this, he will experience heartburn. He has been told he has fatty liver in the past but has not had a recent FibroScan. He otherwise denies any issues with dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, gas or bloating, changes in bowel habits, blood in his stool, melena, unintentional weight loss or fevers. He states he did call the clinic in June regarding diarrhea however this resolved on its own.

Assessment:
RUQ pain: Hx of cholecystectomy. voices frustration stating she has had ongoing RUQ pain. states she has told her PCP but there notes do not mention abdominal pain with recent referral to GI was due to GERD. She denies any acid reflux. Reviewed our past 2 notes with stated no abdominal pain at those times. Noted, our records with prior evaluation in January 2015 due to MEQ/RUQ pain in the setting of normal labs with follow up CT A/P w IV showing no acute intra abdominal or pelvis process.  Difficult to ascertain as patient states pain is not in her abdomen but is under her right lower rib cage but also voices concern that it is her liver. Recent evaluation due to transaminitis with US in March that showed echogenic liver. Likely DILI effect as was taking ashwaghanda supplement with repeat LFTs normalizing after stopping it. Reviewed EGD in April 2024 that showed a hiatal hernia.  Stomach bx with reactive gastropathy; negative H pylori. recent labs with unremarkable liver enzymes (Alk phos 26 low o/w normal). Mild TTP to RUQ/ lower intercostal area. recommended restarting omeprazole but declined as reported that it did not help with her pain. She dose report recent dental work and took Ibuprofen 800mg 2 times. I advised on avoiding NSAIDs but patient states that did not cause her pain. Will check CT Abdomen and pelvis with IV. will check CXR to evaluate lower intercostal area. Query if pain due to adhesions from cholecystectomy.
