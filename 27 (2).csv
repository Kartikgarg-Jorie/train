Abd pain/ Bloating
History of Present Illness:
Ms. Moore is a 63 year old patient who presents for a follow up evaluation.
Last Visit 3/13/2025:  Past 2 years has had:
- Intermittent LUQ pain, often when she is getting off of work as a cashier, has to stand for 4 hour shifts at a time.
- Intermittent umbilical abdominal pain, unrelated to positions/eating. Does not necessarily lead to a BM, but pain resolves for a time after having a BM, before recurring.
- Intermittent nausea/dyspepsia, any time of the day, no obvious trigger.
- Minimal breakthrough acid reflux/heart burn on Pantoprazole 40 mg in am/Pepcid Complete in the afternoon. Also frequent post-prandial burping/belching. Endorses early satiety.
- Mild intermittent constipation.
--> Treat constipation with Miralax/generic, SIBO testing, 4 hour solid phase GES.
- 3/21/2025 - TrioSmart SIBO testing- normal/negative.
Today,
- Multifactorial, but unable to follow up short-term as recommended, and unable to complete GES.
- After discussion, LUQ and umbilical abdominal pain discussed last visit seems to have resolved.
-- Notes that she is no longer working 8-hour shifts, instead doing 4-hour shifts, which seems to have made a difference.
C/o new epigastric pain,can be before work, but majority of the time it is noticeable right when getting off work, and seems to improve if she eats something.
-- Eats light breakfast 8am, then doesn't eat until 4-5 pm after work.
-- Denies frequent NSAID use, or recent antibiotics/steroids.
- Continues to have breakthrough burping symptoms on pantoprazole/famotidine.
-- Notes that she has tried and failed all over-the-counter PPI options (omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, and rabeprazole) twice daily for over 8 weeks.
-- Has found pantoprazole the most effective in minimizing her GERD symptoms including the belching, but not completely resolve burping symptoms.
- Denies significant early satiety, but does admit to significant weight loss of around 50 pounds over 2 years, 3 years ago. For the past year her weight has been stable at around 130 lb.
-- Believes her weight loss was related to improving her diet, her prior significant symptoms with dyspepsia/indigestion, and admits a decreased appetite.
** History **
- 6/18/2024 - UBT - negative

Assessment:
Prior LUQ and umbilical abdominal pains have resolved since last visit, possibly related to her improved work schedule, working 4-hour shifts rather than 8-hour shifts.
- Continues to have some breakthrough burping symptoms on pantoprazole/famotidine, though more classical heartburn/acid reflux symptoms are controlled.
C/o new epigastric abdominal pain for the past 4-8 weeks, which majority of the time develops as she is getting off work, and improves after she eats dinner.
- Typically eating a light breakfast at 8 AM, and then eats dinner around 4 to 5 PM.
Recommend:
- CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast.
- Start eating a small, healthy snack over her 15 min break while working, instead of fasting from 8am to 4/5pm.
- Given prior significant weight loss and decreased appetite, okay to proceed with gastric emptying study.
- Stop pantoprazole, start Voquezna 10 mg once daily. Samples provided.
-- Okay to continue famotidine.
-- Update clinic with response.
- Low threshold to proceed with an EGD, as the epigastric pain is new symptom.
Time spent in counseling and/or coordination of care (including but not limited to reviewing prior records, arranging further services, communicating further with other care providers) was at least 50 minutes with more than 50% of this time spent in face-to-face or direct telecommunication with the patient.

She tells me prior to this she was having diarrhea once a week that would resolve with Imodium. 6 weeks ago her diarrhea escalated and she is now having 3 or 4 episodes daily. Rare bright red blood she thinks is related to hemorrhoids. No focal abdominal pain but she does have some cramps. She does not recall recent antibiotics but has had a worsening clinical course since a prolonged hospitalization last summer for COPD exacerbation complicated by a vocal cord paralysis that she thinks was related to intubation. She is seeing rheumatology and being referred to UT Southwestern for possible neurologic autoimmune disease. She tells me that she had recent stool studies and she was told these were consistent with ulcerative colitis although I do not have the results.

Assessment:
I will obtain her prior records. We discussed the need for diagnostic colonoscopy with biopsies to evaluate for inflammatory bowel disease versus microscopic colitis versus other etiologies. She feels certain based on her multiple recent health issues that she cannot tolerate this. It is reasonable to do a limited treatment course with budesonide as if she responds rapidly and we can wean this it supports a diagnosis of microscopic colitis over inflammatory bowel disease. At that point we could transition to cholestyramine or colesevelam if necessary. We did discuss that if she does not rapidly improve with treatment she may require a colonoscopy and we would need to schedule this at the hospital.
Plan:
Monitor clinical course and call with any problems or worsening symptoms in the interim.
Follow-up with PCP for elevated blood pressure reading*
My office will obtain prior lab results
My office will obtain records from referring physician"

Change in bowel habits, abdominal pain
History of Present Illness:
Cassie is a very pleasant 35-year-old female who presents for evaluation of change in bowel habits and abdominal pain. She notes constipation since she was a child with subsequent hemorrhoids. She routinely uses MiraLAX or stool softeners as needed. Around 6 months ago she had a change in her stooling to diarrhea. She was having 3-4 loose to watery bowel movements per day. She denies any triggering event or medication change. She also is experiencing abdominal pain. This is present in her lower abdomen bilaterally as well as around her umbilicus. She describes this as cramping and squeezing or throbbing. Her pain is worse after defecation. She is also tender to the touch. She does admit occasional rectal bleeding which she relates to hemorrhoids but she is not having any pain at this time. She notes bloating which is present constantly. When symptoms are severe she has associated nausea denies any vomiting. She denies dysphagia or heartburn. She has not had any weight loss. She recently started ibuprofen which has provided relief for her abdominal pain. She was not taking this previously. She has not had any workup for her symptoms. She denies any known GI family history.

History of Present Illness:
Kathlyn Williams is a 65F patient with a history of H. pylori infection, a-Fib (on Eliquis), CHF, SVT, HTN, HLD, obesity, depression, anxiety, OSA, and former smoker who presents to Gastroenterology clinic as a new patient for evaluation of chest pain that started in August 2025. She initially experienced chest pain following physical therapy and eating a salad, which worsened with swallowing and drinking water. The onset of symptoms coincided with increasing Mounjaro 2.5 to 5 mg. Due to the severity of her symptoms, Kathlyn visited the emergency department on August 11th. The ER confirmed her heart was fine and diagnosed her with inflammation in her chest wall, possibly from exercise, and suspected GERD. She was prescribed omeprazole, and the pain improved with medication and time.
She denies feeling any burning or acid reflux (as she had GERD in the past), describing it as just chest pain. While Kathlyn no longer experiences active heartburn, she recalls significant burping when the chest pain occurred. She also had difficulty swallowing water, which caused pain lower in her chest. She denies nausea or vomiting. Kathlyn reports occasional abdominal pain and inconsistent bowel movements. She mentions experiencing urgency and changes in bowel movements after a steroid shot for stenosis in her back and neck. She denies any blood in her stools. She generally have regular bowel movements with prunes and smooth-tea.

reflux and bloating
History of Present Illness:
Ms. Enriquez is a 70-year-old Spanish-speaking only female accompanied by her daughter. She is seen today due to chronic acid reflux and dysphagia. She states she has had reflux her entire life and has been on multiple medications, all without relief. She did have hiatal hernia repair by fundoplication years ago. She was told this would fix her reflux but she continues to have it. She avoids all foods that typically cause acid reflux. She sleeps with her head of bed elevated. She does usually eat a small snack about an hour before going to bed. She feels reflux throughout the day but especially at night. She states she has a burning sensation that goes all the way up to her nose. She is also complaining of abdominal bloating after eating. She denies any nausea or vomiting. She does report solid food dysphagia but cannot identify any specific foods. She did an EGD in 2023 that showed gastroesophageal flap valve classified as Hill grade 1, a partial fundoplication was found, benign-appearing esophageal stenosis, but was otherwise normal.
She does report frequent bowel movements and cramping in the morning but typically resolves throughout the day. She denies any blood in her stool. Colonoscopy in April of this year was normal.

This followed with an episode of vomiting which has not recurred but her nausea persists. She saw her PCP and had labs. CBC, CMP, lipase were normal-reviewed on her portal during visit. Gallbladder US showed fatty liver and a gallstone-no records. She is still nauseated and has no appetite. She has been on liquids, jello since she has been sick. She ate mashed potatoes last night and did okay. She feels like when she swallows- sensation of food ""going around something."" She feels like something is stuck when she swallows. She is on a daily PPI. She was on twice daily dose at once point but decreased back down to once daily. She is taking Carafate as needed with some improvement. She has history of Peptic ulcer disease. She is on low dose aspirin daily. Denies other NSAID use and only takes Tylenol. Her last EGD here was in 2015.
She has noticed mild constipation with her recent diet changes but not taking anything. She had a single episode ofdiarrhea once last week but has returned to normal. She was having epigastric pain but has no abdominal pain today. No overt GI bleeding. Her father had colon polyps (in his 60s). No family history of colon cancer. She has never had a colonoscopy.

Annual follow up for IBD colitis
History of Present Illness:
PRIOR HX:
This is a 17-year-old young gentleman currently doing very well who has a history of severe abdominal symptoms in the past. Around the year 2011 he became ill and developed abdominal pain with diarrhea, weight loss that then spiraled into significant anxiety and depression. He underwent extensive workups and was ultimately told he had pancreatic insufficiency. It sounds like it is a pancreatic stimulation test and perhaps a stool test for fecal fat. He was placed on Creon but continued to struggle with abdominal symptoms over the years and had a pediatric psychiatrist and psychologist. He noted negative genetic testing for hereditary pancreatitis. His current pediatric GI doctor has questioned a diagnosis of pancreatic insufficiency. There was an attempt to stop pancreatic enzymes about 5-6 years ago. At that time he did well for a few months then developed greasy stools and recurrent abdominal symptoms so restart medication.
Over the past 2 years he has done very well and has actually no issues. He is no longer seeing a psychiatrist and has one last visit with a psychologist he's done with that as well. He is very active in school and seems well adjusted.
From my standpoint is not entirely clear that he truly has pancreatic insufficiency. Certainly irritable bowels a much more common diagnosis then pancreatic insufficiency of unknown etiology.
Today he and his mother and I discussed considering at some point a trial of stopping Creon and see how he does. If we were to do this we probably do this over the summer in a time when he does not have significant obligations or stresses. If we do this I would then probably we'll check a stool for fecal elastase as well as a 48 hour stool collection for fecal fat perhaps 1 month after stopping enzymes.
He will call me should he wish to try this at some point. In the meantime is very reasonable to continue Creon. In the past he has been severely debilitated from his symptoms and now is doing very well so I do not feel the need to rush into changing anything
3/12/2019 (MB) - Jacob Decker is a 18 year old male who is seen today for a follow-up visit. Feeling really well. Still taking creon before meals but would like to discuss stopping medication. Taking miralax and one tablet of Dulcolax daily. BMs are mainly X1 BM per day but may vary. If having increasing constipation he increases miralax. No BRBPR or melena. No abd pain. Weight stable. In senior year. Plans to take AP calculus exam May 2019. Wil attend Kansas State in the fall to study mechanical engineering.
5/8/2019 (MB) - Jacob Decker is a 18 year old male who is seen today for a follow-up visit. Having X1 BM/Day without BRBPR or melena. Taking 5 caps of creon before meals and 2 with snack. Had increasing sx of constipation last weekend; used a ""miralax clean out"" as previously instructed by Peds GI. Weight stable. AP calculus exam is one week from today followed by senior trip to Disney World and graduation.
Pleasant 18 y/o male presents for f/u. Finishing senior year in the next two weeks. Will decrease creon dose over one week after graduation. Will obtain fecal elastase and 48 hour stool collection for fecal fat one month after stopping creon. Recommended keeping record of number of stools per day and consistency.
labs 6/19 - elastase low at 111, fecal fat 24 hour collect 5.6 grams/24 hour
given how well he has done on creon and given these labs which show markedly depressed fecal elastase and quantitative fat that is approaching 7g/24 hours, I would recommend that he restart and remain on creon
creon lipase 36,000 USP units - 2 pills with meals, 1 with snacks should be adequate...
OFFICE f/u 7.30.19 -doing well. came off creon for 1 month and then had above testing - off creon he noted more frequent bm. no real cramping. mom notes in 2013 fecal elastase 48 and may 2013 it was 11 and 1/12 - 23. all of this is from his mom however.........
on ezymes for past week and was off for 5 weeks.
3/11/2020 (MB) - Jacob Decker is a 19 year old male who is seen today for a follow-up visit. Engineering Major at Kansas State and lives in dorm. Eats a consistent diet while at school. Some weight gain. Home on Spring Break. Has been taking creon most days but after a change in his schedule has not been as consistent (takes at dinner but will miss dose at lunch). No steatorrhea or diarrhea. No change in BHs.
Started noticing BRB on stool early January with most BMs. No rectal pain. Has intermittent constipation for which he uses miralax. BRBPR Sx slowly increasing over last month with dramatic increase 3/6/2020. Has been feeling need to have a BM and having BRB filling the toilet. He had taken advil for back pain before driving home. No other NSAIDs. Started seeing BRB on TP, on stool and filling toilet. No rectal pain.
Has had occasional upper abd bloating but cannot relate to food triggers. No N/V, fever or chills.
Has hx of anal fissures.
No heart palpitations, dizziness upon standing or DOE.
Pleasant 19 y/o male with hx of IBS and EPI presents for evaluation of BRBPR onset early 1/2020 with increase in sx 3/6/2020.
Rectal exam with small fissure anteriorly and internal hemorrhoids with BRB.
Pt to continue creon. Will titrate miralax to a soft BM.
Will obtain CBC to assess for anemia.
For hemorrhoids recommend sitz baths and hydrocortisone suppository. Emphasized the importance of preventing constipation.
Recommend calmoseptine for early fissure. Also emphasized not over cleansing of rectal area.
Given repeated hematochezia, recommend proceeding to colonoscopy to be certain no other luminal pathology beyond hemorrhoids/fissure.
COLONOSCOPY 3/2020 - Jacob Decker is a 19 year old male here for a colonoscopy. Has blood with every bowel movement. Blood coats the stool as well as in toilet paper. NO diarrhea. Still taking Creon for pancreatic insufficiency. He is using the suppository twice daily without any improvement. Has intermittent constipation for which he uses miralax. Has hx of anal fissures.
****FINDINGS: The colon is long and redundant. The distal 10 cm of terminal ileum is examined which appears normal. There is a polypoid lesion in the proximal transverse colon - see pics - favor focally inflamed edematous mucosa - however biopsies taken separately and tattoo placed adjacent to but not involving the region in case bx were to show serrated polyp.. Multiple cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology in the proximal transverse colon. 5 ml spot injection was successfully applied for tattooing. mild to moderate proctitis involving the distal 5cm of rectum from dentate line to inferior rectal valve. from inferior rectal valve to rectosigmoid junction is a very mild proctitis. sharp transition to normal mucosa at this point with normal mucosa extending to the very proximal transverse colon. from the very proximal transverse colon to the cecum is a mild to moderate continuous colitis. the TI is normal - distal 10cm examined. findings most c/w crohns dz.

Acute and chronic pancreatitis have been described in adults and children with inflammatory bowel disease (either Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis) and may precede the diagnosis of the bowel disease [68,69]. A common feature of these reports is the presence of colonic disease. In the setting of these diseases, the pathogenesis of the pancreatitis probably is multifactorial, including side effects of medications, but an autoimmune mechanism is also possible.
In patients with UC, factors independently associated with AIP included proctitis (odds ratio [OR], 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-6.3; P =.007) and colectomy (OR, 7.1; 95% CI, 2.5-20; P =.0003). In patients with CD, AIP was significantly associated with fewer perianal lesions (OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.03-0.77; P =.023), non-stricturing non-penetrating CD (OR, 6.7; 95% CI, 1.25-33.3; P =.0029), and higher rate of colectomy (OR, 27.8; 95% CI, 3.6-217; P =.0029).
In a multicenter retrospective analysis of patients with AIP and IBD, followed for an average of 5.7±4.9 years, we found most to have type 2 AIP. Two-thirds of patients have UC, often with proctitis. One-third of patients have CD, often with inflammatory features. Patients with IBD and AIP have higher rates of colectomy than patients with just IBD
telehealth visit 6.11.20
Inflammatory bowel disease: Recent colonoscopy showed moderate proctitis and mild colitis involving the right colon. The ileum was normal. The distribution was patchy consistent with Crohn's. At that time he was having more urgency and bleeding. Currently the bleeding is gone. He has no urgency. He has a bowel movement daily or every few days requiring a laxative. At this time recommended continuing oral mesalamine and Canasa suppositories. He needs to have another colonoscopy to remove the serrated adenoma that was biopsied but not removed. At the time of follow-up colonoscopy to look for mucosal improvement. If indeed there has been significant improvement particularly in the rectum we can then try to taper down and perhaps off the Canasa. He needs to have blood work which we discussed and he will do so for me. We discussed inflammatory bowel great detail and the fact that he may need more aggressive medication future.
Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency: Etiology has been unknown but there are case reports of chronic pancreatitis developing in patients years before the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease. He has never had acute pancreatitis and as such classic autoimmune pancreatitis as an etiology for his chronic pancreatitis I think would be unlikely. However there may certainly be a link between his inflammatory bowel disease and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. He does well on Creon. This will be continued for now.
Anxiety: He's been having significant anxiety recently has a history of this. We will start Paxil and I've given him the name of a psychologist, Chris bedard. I've also recommended he establish care with an adult internist to manage this moving forward. I provided him with this, the number of days. I did discuss with him and his family that at times SSRIs can actually exacerbate anxiety and this happens he stop medication call me. I've also has a call in about 4 weeks to let me know how the medication is working.
Personal history of colon polyps: There is a serrated adenoma that was biopsied but not removed during last colonoscopy as I thought it was likely inflammatory fold. It was however tattooed. We will now proceed with colonoscopy and removed this polyp.
Labs 7/20 – hbv core negat, tb neg, crp normal, esr normal cbc normal u/a neg for protein, normal fecal cal,
COLONOSCOPY 7/2020 - 20 year old male here for surveillance colonoscopy. Last colonoscopy was in 3/16/2020 where pathology was consistent with chronic active colitis. He is taking lialda and canasa - blood gone. no symptoms. No urgency. having 1 bm per day.
Biopsies from the polypoid lesion in proximal transverse colon c/w serrated adenoma which was not removed on 3/16/2020.
Anxiety symptoms much improved after starting Paxil
**** FINDINGS- The colon is long and redundant. The ileo-cecal valve is normal. The distal 15 cm of terminal ileum is examined and it is completely normal. compared to prior c-scope 3/20 there is marked IMPROVEMENT. the entire rectum is now normal as is the rest of the colonic mucosa with the exception of very mild focal inflammatory changes of the cecum and proximal transverse colon.
- single 2 cm polyp was found in the hepatic flexure. A piece-meal polypectomy was performed
RECS-->   given marked improvement in rectal disease can try to taper canasa as tolerated. recommend going to every other night for 1 month, then every 3rd night for 1 month and if still doing well, stopping canasa. do NOT stop the mesalamine pills. these will be needed long term
repeat colon 3 years
PATH– rectal bx unremarkable. rectal dz resolved on bx. polyp was a ssa - repeat colon 3 years.

Doing well on Lialda 4 tablets daily without abdominal pain or N/V. Has 1 formed BM daily w/o overt GI bleeding.
No fecal urgency or steatorrhea. Has actually been gaining more weight than he wants. Is not truly consistent with creon use.
Rare alcohol use lately, not even weekly. A year ago during football seasons drinking more frequently.
Currently has internship and hopeful that he will have job with that company upon graduating.

Just had fibroscan done today.
Currently at 324 pounds but 5/2021 was 297.
Frustrated with difficulty losing weight.
Takes 6,000 steps a day and works out on his peloton. Manages his caloric intake carefully and eating less than 2,000 calories a day. Mom has h/o of hypothyroid. He has not been checked.
- No GI symptoms today.
Maternal grandmother with stomach cancer s/p resection.
***A/P:  22 yo M with h/o Crohn's disease and EPI here for evaluation of elevated liver enzymes likely due to NASH.
No GI symptoms today and overall doing well form Crohns and EPI standpoint.
To continue Lialda and Creon.
He have gained 27 pounds withn the last year unintentionally. He has family history of hypothyroidism therefore will check TSH along with repeat CMP and CBC today.
We discussed NAFLD managed in depth and its possible progression to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Importance of weight loss discussed. Pending fibroscan. Will refer to nutritionist or encourage him to see if there is a nutritionist at his college that can help him make a diet plan.
Will refer him to chronic care management program through GI Alliance to see if a semaglutide can be started. We discussed GI side effects and he is agreeable to starting medication if he qualifies.
Fibrosure S1-2, F0
CRCS due 7/2023 d/t personal h/o SSA.
COLONOSCOPY 8/2023:  Mild proctitis, 5mm recurrent polyp in hepatic flexure 6mm polyp in transverse colon, IH's, TI and remainder of colon normal. PATH: Recurrent polyp in hepatic flexure was SSA, other polyp hyperplastic. Mild chronic active colitis of rectum. Repeat 2y.  Could add canasa if desired.
RETURNS 11/21/2023 (Betsy)-  annual f/u. He is home this week from college (out of state)
1) Crohn's - he is currently on mesalamine 4/d, and clinically doing great.  Reports 1 formed stool/d, no blood, no abd pain, no EIMs. C-scope in 8/2023 showed some mild proctitis, so he added canasa at bedtime, but really has not noted any change in sxs so he wishes to stop. He really had minimal to no symptoms even at the time of the colonoscopy.
2) EPI-  he has not been compliant with Creon really at all in recent months, and has not had an increase in GI sxs (no diarrhea, steatorrhea, etc).  This med is becoming more costly for him, and he wonders if he can just stop it and see how he does.  Pancreatic elastase and quantitative fecal fat last checked in 2019-->  elastase was 111 (significantly low) and fecal fat was ""normal"" but was  approaching high so we advised him to continue at that time.
3) Fatty liver/elevated LFTs:   FIBROSCAN 11/2022 S0, F0-1.  LFTS now NORMAL- excellent!  He has lost a significant amount of weight (350-->263) with healthy diet and exercise alone, and drinks very little alcohol at this point (once per month). We were planning a 1 year repeat fibroscan, but given the benign findings last year, his excellent healthy lifestyle with weight loss and normalization of LFTs, I think we can hold off on this for now.
4) PH colon polyps (SSAs in 2020 and 2023).  Colon recalled for 2y (due 2025)
RETURNS 6/13/2024 (Betsy)- 6 month f/u. He just graduated from college and the next 2y he will be living in various places.
1) Crohn's- still doing great clinically on mesalamine 4/d, no diarrhea, blood, abd pain. Annual labs/UA 4/2024 looked good.  No change planned, to repeat labs/UA in 1y.  Colonoscopy due 8/2025
2) EPI- has been OFF pancreatic enzymes completely for probably about year, and doing fine.  No steatorrhea, diarrhea, or difficulty maintaining weight (he has to work hard to lose weight on purpos)  No fecal fat in stool 12/2023. Takes Vitamin E BID
3) fatty liver/ elevated LFTs
LABS 4/2024: AST 59 (FIB4: 0.78)--> get Fibroscan
FIBROSCAN 5/2024: (F0-F1, S0) - still no fibrosis or steatosis--> continue with weight loss and continue vitamin e 400 iu BID.
- he continues to do well with weight loss (350-->263-->227). Excellent!
4) PH colon polyps (SSAs in 2020 and 2023).  Colon recalled for 2y (due 8/2025)
***A/P:
no change in meds, cont Vit E, and cont to work on weight loss. Labs due 4/2025, colonoscopy due 8/2025.
RETURNS 9/11/2025 (Betsy)- 25 yo M with h/o IBD colitis (Crohn's colitis favored over UC, based on distribution at first colonoscopy) returns today for annual followup.  He has been living out of state for the last year. He called in 9/2024 with blood in stool- labs and stool studies were normal so we recommended he have eval by a local gastroenterologist, which he did.  Colonoscopy by Dr. Mirza in IN on 10/17/2024 showed mild active colitis involving rectosigmoid only (records requested).  Mesalamine enema was added to his oral mesalamine for a few weeks, and sxs resolved. Saw Dr. Mirza for f/u in 7/2025, oral mesalamine was decreased from 4.8g to 2.4g daily and he's doing well, no diarrhea/blood, or EIMs.  In fact he is a little constipated.  Using miralax with good results at BID.  No recent labs.
- No problems with EPI in years.
- Fatty liver- weight up a little since last seen  (227-->245).  Will check labs today and plan repeat Fibroscan at 2 year point.

Follow up
History of Present Illness:
This is a routine follow-up visit for Jennie, who was last seen in March 2025. The follow-up is primarily for elevated liver enzymes. There is a history of four hospitalizations last year since September, with the most recent admission in February 2025 to UTMB hospital for vomiting. This episode was associated with elevated liver enzymes secondary to isoniazid treatment. The isoniazid was initiated for a positive tuberculosis test, which was required before starting Tremfya for psoriatic arthritis. The isoniazid was discontinued in February 2025, and a course of rifampin was completed in June 2025. She are currently still on Tremfya, administered by Dr. Wong, for psoriatic arthritis, which is reported to be slightly helpful. She also have a history of lupus, diagnosed in 1974, and are on a tapering dose of prednisone, currently at 5 mg daily. A history of fatty liver disease is also noted. There is a report of a liver biopsy performed approximately 20 years ago in Houston, but the results are unknown. No alcohol use or smoking is reported.
Prior Tests Reviewed:
- Labs from UTMB on 06/05/2025 showed a bilirubin of 1.3 and an AST of 136.
- Review of UTMB chart shows AST levels were significantly elevated in February 2025, around 300 (range 30-40), and have been trending down but remain elevated. It is noted that the AST has been high for years.
- Autoimmune workup from the February 2025 admission at UTMB was reviewed. The liver kidney microsomal antibody and anti-mitochondrial antibody were negative. The smooth muscle antibody was slightly elevated at 48, though the smooth muscle titer was negative (<1:20). Immunoglobulin G was normal at 1300.
3/19/2025 She is here along with her daughter for hospital follow-up after recent admission at UTMB for vomiting and weakness. She was also found to have elevated troponin which was thought to be type II MI in the setting of hypovolemia.
Elevated LFTs were noted during admission. Per daughter, his seemed to start shortly after she was started on rifampin/isoniazid for latent TB. She has TB testing every year by her rheumatologist who is treating her with Tremfya for psoriatic arthritis. She also has lupus which is not currently treated however in the past she has used both Plaquenil and azathioprine.
While in the hospital, she was seen by infectious disease. Given high suspicion for DILI related to isoniazid, they discontinued isoniazid in favor of rifampin monotherapy. LFTs remain elevated as of 3/6/2025. Specifically ALT 163, AST 227, alk phos and total bili are within normal range. Chronic liver workup was completed during hospitalization and was negative except for positive SMA. She has a history of transaminitis which was previously attributed to lupus. Discussed the possibility of underlying AIH which would require liver biopsy for diagnosis. She is on cilostazol which may need to be held 48 hours prior. Discussed potential treatment for autoimmune hepatitis which would be steroids or azathioprine. While she did not have any obvious side effects with azathioprine in the past, she has had 2 episodes of pancreatitis of unclear etiology and we would generally avoid using AZA based on that. I will discuss case with GI and rheumatologist if needed to help reach consensus on utility of liver biopsy in her case.
11/4/2024 This is a telehealth visit being conducted at the request of patient from my office (11920 Astoria Blvd, St 410, Houston 77089) using audio only communication since video is unavailable. Appropriate consent was obtained. This is a routine follow-up with patient's daughter also present on the call. We reviewed most recent labs which showed stable anemia at 10.8 with iron panel in the low/normal range. No folate or vitamin B12 deficiencies noted. Appears consistent with recent GI bleed which has since resolved. Patient has been monitoring closely for melena or blood in the stool. Symptoms appear to have resolved after discontinuing Plavix. Currently she is on cilostazol monotherapy since she did not tolerate aspirin in the past. We also reviewed slightly elevated lipase on most recent labs however it has been much higher in the past. No current symptoms of abdominal pain or nausea. Recent CT scan at UTMB was unrevealing for pancreatic abnormalities. Recommend follow-up in 6 months or sooner for new GI concerns.
10/01/2024 She is here for hospital follow up along with daughter who helps give history after recent admission to UTMB due to GI bleeding with melena, fatigue, lightheadedness. She was discharged home a week ago. No bleeding or melena reported. Partial records obtained from patient/family since full records were not available at the time of visit. She required more than 1 blood transfusion and underwent EGD which was overall unrevealing. Patient declined colonoscopy given historically challenging procedure due to long loopy colon. Plavix was discontinued prior to arrival in favor of aspirin monotherapy. she had been taking Plavix for stroke that occurred in 2020. Today she is feeling well with no new complaints. no repeat imaging recommended since this was just completed at outside hospital. I will obtain the records and important to her chart for review. We have mutually agreed to defer colonoscopy given age, bleeding resolution, and technically challenging procedure. Recommend repeat labs to include iron panel and lipase as it was elevated last year. She denies any recent abdominal pain.
08/14/2023 This is a follow up appointment. Labs in 08/23 with Cr 1.21, AST 64, lipase 567, IgG4 normal. Patient reports that abdominal pain has improved since last visit. She notes that it seems to be worse after eating certain foods like ice cream and nuts, which she has since cut out from her diet. She is having daily soft BMs with Colace. Denies nausea, vomiting, visible rectal bleeding. Low suspicion for autoimmune pancreatitis at this point with unrevealing CT this year and IgG4 normal. Elevated lipase could be secondary to CKD. Plan to follow up in 6 months, will plan on repeating lipase at that time.
6/27/2023 Patient is here for follow up. Patient is still complaining of epigastric pain that is intermittent, fleeting, and worse with certain movements. Not impacted by eating or defecation. She sometimes takes Tylenol for the pain with some relief. Her BMs are regular with Colace daily. Denies nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, weight loss. She had a CT a/p 6/21 which showed colitis and fatty liver, no masses or inflammation of pancreas. She followed up with rheumatologist last month, who only manages IgG4 related autoimmune pancreatitis. IgG 4 ordered last visit but was not completed. Epigastric pain possible autoimmune pancreatitis vs. chronic constipation and loopy colon. Repeat labs and follow up in 6 weeks.
03/27/2023 She is here for follow-up along with her daughter. Since last visit her diarrhea appears to have resolved. She takes Colace for her suspected overflow diarrhea and notes normal bowel movements at this time. She has stopped taking probiotics. She continues to complain of intermittent epigastric discomfort after eating. She was noted to have elevated lipase on routine blood tests in December along with elevated inflammation markers and liver function tests concerning for possible autoimmune process. An ultrasound was ordered by her primary care physician which showed prominent pancreatic and common bile duct. A CT was ordered but she is still pending insurance approval. We did discuss possibility of autoimmune pancreatitis given her history of psoriatic arthritis as well as lupus. An IgG subclass 4 was ordered but she did not do this lab and she is willing to do this now.
12/14/2022 This is a telehealth visit being conducted at the request of patient from my office (11920 Astoria Blvd, St 410, Houston 77089) using audio only communication since video is unavailable. Appropriate consent was obtained. This is a routine follow-up after 1 month with patient's daughter also present on the call. She reports ongoing weight loss and new diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis as well as possible pancreatitis due to elevated pancreatic enzymes checked by her rheumatologist. Labs will be obtained for review and further counseling. She does have a history of what sounds like idiopathic pancreatitis, 2 episodes in the past. Will consider IgG subclass 4 to rule out autoimmune pancreatitis if not done previously. Of note she had a very recent CT scan with contrast which did not show any pancreatic abnormality. She also had stool tests including fecal elastase which were within normal limits. Her bowel movements are a little bit better since our last visit and she is not using MiraLAX since it upset her stomach. Advised trial of Colace instead.
11/14/2022 She is here along with her daughter after 2 weeks. In the meantime we have repeated her C. difficile stool test which was negative. She also had a urinalysis which was negative for any infection. She still has minimal low-grade fever which seems attributable to her lupus at this point. No GI contraindication to lupus treatment as appropriate per her rheumatologist. She still has vague lower abdominal pain and diarrhea about 4-8 times per day. Recent CT scan showed increased stool burden and she does have altered anatomy with severe redundancy in sigmoid colon on prior colonoscopy. We discussed the high likelihood of overflow diarrhea and C. difficile carrier status rather than true infection. Discussed possibility of referral to colorectal surgery to discuss possibility of diverting colostomy however she is very hesitant. Attending gastroenterologist also present for visit today.
11/01/2022 She is here along with her daughter. She continues to complain of intermittent fevers up to 101. Also continues to have diarrhea. She went to the emergency room few weeks ago with similar complaints and had testing including labs which were overall normal. CT scan showed increased stool burden but otherwise no active signs of infection. She remains on vancomycin given recent history of C. difficile toxin positive gene test on 9/23/2022 and currently on a tapered treatment. She also has lupus and currently going through a flareup with pain in both her hands which is where typically her lupus effects. Her rheumatologist would like to switch to stronger medication but given ongoing fever they are holding off on further immunosuppression. I have recommended expanding infectious disease work-up and if negative will consider aggressive treatment for lupus which can be discussed with her rheumatologist. Given presence of solid stool on CT this is less likely a infectious disease as a cause for diarrhea and more likely overflow diarrhea from constipation.
10/20/2022 This is a telehealth visit being conducted at the request of patient from my office (11920 Astoria Blvd, St 410, Houston 77089) using audio only communication since video is unavailable. Appropriate consent was obtained. This is a 2-day follow-up. In the interim she went to the ER and had Memorial Hermann Southeast related and was assessed with labs and CT and later discharged home. Labs did not reveal any leukocytosis and she was afebrile at the time of presentation. CT scan did not show any colitis and in fact showed moderate stool burden. Patient continues to have abdominal pain and frequent diarrhea. Repeat stool testing was deferred for now in favor for longer duration of vancomycin. We also discussed weaning her off of PPI to decrease risk for future C. difficile recurrence. Patient will use H2 blockers instead in the meantime. Mild macrocytic anemia noted, this will need to be rechecked in the future. Continues to deny any bleeding.
10/18/2022 This is a telehealth visit being conducted at the request of patient from my office (11920 Astoria Blvd, St 410, Houston 77089) using audio only communication since video is unavailable. Appropriate consent was obtained. This is a routine follow-up after 1 month. Since then she was diagnosed with C. difficile on stool test, fecal calprotectin was also elevated in the 600 range. Patient was started on extended course of vancomycin 4 times daily and has about a week left of the medication. She has not contacted office to discuss symptoms however she reports persistent diarrhea about 10+ episodes per day with associated fever up to 102 earlier this morning. She also has abdominal distention and pain which is worse on the right lower quadrant. She is having a hard time maintaining her hydration. She denies any rectal bleeding. She tells me she is supposed to start on a new infusion (Saphnelo) for her lupus later this week which I have advised against given ongoing infection. Given lack of improvement on worsening symptoms including abdominal pain and distention with fever I recommended ER evaluation today for stat labs and CT scan, possible admission for inpatient management if appropriate. Patient agrees. Total time spent was 30 minutes
09/07/2022 This is a telehealth visit being conducted at the request of patient from my office (11920 Astoria Blvd, St 410, Houston 77089) using audio only communication since video is unavailable. Appropriate consent was obtained. This is a routine follow-up with patient after recent EGD/colonoscopy. We discussed procedure findings in detail including mild gastritis and small hiatal hernia, biopsies are negative for H. pylori. Patient reports acid reflux symptoms which are moderately controlled with pantoprazole daily. Colonoscopy was incomplete due to severe redundancy in sigmoid colon. She had a barium enema later that day which did not reveal any colonic lesion. Most recent labs reviewed and showed mild anemia with hemoglobin of 10.8 and no evidence of iron deficiency. Her main complaint is worsening diarrhea ever since her colonoscopy/barium enema. She also has abdominal cramping which she is treating with dicyclomine. She denies any rectal bleeding. She does have underlying IBS however current symptoms are more frequent and watery. Recommended comprehensive stool testing which she is agreeable to. Of note she does have a history of C. difficile and took a Z-Pak about a month ago for upper respiratory infection.
5/31/2022 She is here for follow-up along with her daughter. She has been sent back by her PCP and complains of anemia. She was noted to have a hemoglobin of around 11.7 in April of this year, 11 4 weeks ago and 10.72 weeks ago. She complains of being tired all the time. Denies any specific bleeding. She is on Plavix given history of 4 strokes previously approximately 2 years ago. Last colonoscopy was in 2017 which was negative and last EGD was in 2015 which was negative at that time. She does have history of steatosis with grade 1 and stage I fibrosis on liver biopsy in 2015. I recommended that she consult with her neurologist here for ongoing antiplatelet therapy is warranted in light of her progressive anemia and if it would be appropriate to switch her to an enteric-coated 81 mg aspirin. We will order labs to further investigate anemia, check for nutritional disorders and if it is persistent consideration for EGD and colonoscopy pending cardiac clearance. Risks and benefits of procedure discussed in detail.
04/05/2022  This is a telehealth visit being conducted at the request of patient from my office (11920 Astoria Blvd, St 410, Houston 77089) using bidirectional synchronous video communication tool. Appropriate informed consent was obtained. Patient called with worsening stomach cramps and frequent stools. She is concerned about possability of C diff recurrence. Stools are mostly solid. No bloody stool. She does have low-grade fevers and lower abdominal cramping pain intermittently. She is using dicyclomine with some improvement. No recent antibiotic use. Recommended repeat C. difficile test followed by prolonged antibiotic course if indicated. We should also consider transitioning her off of PPI to H2 blocker to help reduce risk for C. difficile recurrence. I will contact patient for further instructions once labs are resulted.
1/19/2022 This is a telehealth visit being conducted at the request of patient from my office (11920 Astoria Blvd, St 410, Houston 77089) using bidirectional synchronous video communication tool. Appropriate informed consent was obtained. This is a routine follow-up after 2 months. Patient is doing well with no new GI complaints. We reviewed most recent ultrasound which showed a prior cholecystectomy and mild fatty liver. No acute changes noted. She denies any abdominal pain. She still has mild intermittent diarrhea which she equates to IBS-D. No recent symptoms similar to prior C. difficile infection. She had labs last month with outside physician which we will request records for. Recommend routine follow-up in 6 months or sooner if she has any worsening symptoms or abnormal labs
11/30/2021 She is here along with her care provider. She notes significant improvement in diarrhea after extending the course of oral vancomycin. I did warn her against taking antibiotics unless it is absolutely necessary due to history of C. difficile infection. I recommended that she stay on probiotics. She does have history of irritable bowel syndrome with the diarrhea has intermittent cramps, was previously taking Librax. Given the potential side effects of excess sedation and her advanced age I recommended consider dicyclomine. Recently she was noted to have elevated liver function tests with routine labs with her rheumatologist for lupus with ALT of 75 and AST of 185. She was previously taking Imuran 3 times a day and it has been reduced to twice a day. She is status post cholecystectomy. Denies any nausea vomiting or right upper quadrant pain but does have generalized abdominal discomfort. I recommended that we get a baseline ultrasound of the liver given elevated liver function test. I did discuss possibility that elevated liver tests could also be from lupus itself and not necessarily a drug reaction.
11/10/2021 This is a telehealth visit being conducted at the request of patient from my office (11920 Astoria Blvd, St 410, Houston 77089) using audio only communication since video is unavailable. Appropriate consent was obtained. This is a routine follow-up after 2 weeks. In that timeframe patient was diagnosed with C. difficile colitis and started on oral vancomycin. Ciprofloxacin and metronidazole were discontinued upon stool test findings. She also had a CT scan of abdomen pelvis which shows colonic diverticulosis with surrounding inflammation suggestive of diverticulitis abutting vaginal cuff and possible cystitis. Patient has had recent urinalysis and vaginal exam which were negative. Her abdominal pain has almost completely resolved however she is still having frequent diarrhea without bleeding or fever. Recommend continue vancomycin as prescribed and follow-up as scheduled in 2 weeks. She will contact office if she has any new or worsening symptoms in the meantime. Total time spent was 20 minutes.
10/25/2021 Patient is here with her daughter for initial visit. She was previously seen by one of our partners in 2017. Patient reports chronic diarrhea for most of her life which has worsened in the past 1 year. She is currently having frequent very loose stools about 8/day. She also reports some diffuse abdominal pain which is worse in lower abdomen. She was recently treated with an unknown antibiotic for urinary tract infection however diarrhea symptoms predated this antibiotic. She has some intermittent low-grade fevers which they attribute to her history of lupus. She was hospitalized for a stroke in May 2020 and has been on Plavix since that time. She has multiple associated comorbidities including CHF and COPD and will require clearance if any endoscopic evaluation is planned. Today we reviewed colonoscopy report from 2017 which was negative except for simoid diverticulosis, no biopsies obtained. On exam she does have some lower abdominal tenderness worse in suprapubic area. I recommend treatment with Cipro and Flagyl as well as comprehensive stool test to rule out other infectious pathogens and check fecal calprotectin. She will also complete a CT scan of abdomen pelvis prior to follow-up visit. We could consider colonoscopy in the future however prefer to manage with noninvasive methods if possible given her comorbidities.
3/7/2017 JENNIE ONEAL is seen today for a follow-up visit. Patient reports that trial of metform for NAFLD failed due to severe diarrhea and fecal incontinence. We agreed to stop it. We reviewed ways to decrease calorie intake in the setting of NAFLD and otherwise negative work up of chronic liver disease. We also reviewed her colonoscopy, repeat in 10 years recommended.
She has intermittent diarrhea and relies on loperamide PRN. it would be ok to continue with that approach.
2/6/2017 - JENNIE ONEAL is seen today for a follow-up visit. Patient is referred for colorectal cancer screening. There is no family history of colorectal neoplasia. Patient denies any hematochezia/ rectal bleeding, change in bowel habit or stool caliber, abdominal pain, nausea, emesis, heartburn, odynophagia, dysphagia, early satiety, weight loss.
Patient also with f/u for NAFLD with early fibrosis. She reports attempts for weight loss have been unsuccessful. No etoh intake. She has a family member with A1-Antitrypsin deficiency, her levels were normal in 2015.
6/23/2015 - JENNIE ONEAL is seen today for a follow-up visit. We reviewed biopsy results. No evidence of autoimmune hepatitis. However she does have G1S1 steatohepatitis on liver biopsy. These findings are consistent with chronic liver disease due to NAFLD. We discussed weight loss techniques as well as need for surveillance in view of early fibrosis noted. She is also intolerant to zantac with severe return of her abdominal symptoms, so I agreed to let her get back to omeprazole.
4/20/2015 - JENNIE ONEAL is seen today for a follow-up visit. We reviewed EGD results which only show mild esophagitis. Because of her concern of side effects of PPI and calcium absorption, we agreed to switch to zantac.
Her labs reviewed a mildly elevated actin antibody as well as positive ANA with a cetromere pattern. I suspect these are related to Scleroderma rather than autoimmune hepatitis. We discussed benefits and risks of liver biopsy to rule out autoimmune hepatitis and agreed to proceed.
3/9/2015 - JENNIE ONEAL is seen for an initial visit today. Patient reports known history of elevation of liver enzymes, presumed to be from fatty liver. No formal work up except for liver enzymes and ultrasounds per patient.
She reports no risk factors for viral hepatitis. No family history of chronic liver disease. She does not drink alcohol excessively. She reports a history of scleroderma with associated reflux symptoms. Most days controlled with over the counter medications.

GERD
History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 41-year-old female presenting with gastroesophageal reflux disease and esophageal stricture. She reports a history of reflux symptoms dating back to her time in graduate school, where she experienced significant swallowing difficulties. The patient underwent two esophageal dilations around 2007-2008, which temporarily resolved her swallowing issues.
In the past five years, her symptoms have worsened, with persistent heartburn despite daily use of proton pump inhibitors like Prilosec and Protonix. She experiences nocturnal symptoms severe enough to wake her, accompanied by hoarseness and wheezing, suggestive of possible aspiration.
The patient has been managing her symptoms by avoiding trigger foods and using medications like famotidine and Pepcid as needed. Her father had a history of Barrett's esophagus, raising concerns about potential esophageal changes.
Medications:
- Prilosec (omeprazole), daily, for gastroesophageal reflux disease
- Protonix (pantoprazole), daily, for gastroesophageal reflux disease
- Famotidine, as needed, for heartburn
- Pepcid, as needed, for heartburn

Colonoscopy at age 45
Additional Notes:
The patient presents with persistent gastroesophageal reflux disease and a history of esophageal stricture. Given the family history of Barrett's esophagus, an endoscopy is warranted to evaluate the esophageal lining for any precancerous changes. The endoscopy will also provide an opportunity to perform dilation if the stricture is contributing to her symptoms. The current medication regimen may be adjusted based on the findings to optimize symptom control and prevent complications.
- Continue taking current medications as prescribed.
- Avoid known trigger foods to help manage symptoms.
- Schedule an endoscopy as discussed to evaluate the esophagus and consider dilation if necessary.
- Follow up with the office after the procedure to discuss results and any necessary changes to treatment.
This note was created in part by using voice recognition software and was reviewed by the medical provider to ensure accuracy.
Assessment:
1. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)<br>The patient continues to experience significant reflux symptoms despite daily use of proton pump inhibitors. An endoscopy is planned to assess the esophageal lining and check for any changes consistent with Barrett's esophagus. Medication adjustments may be considered based on endoscopic findings.<br><br>2. Esophageal stricture<br>The patient has a history of esophageal stricture with prior dilations. An endoscopy will allow for potential dilation if necessary, to prevent further complications such as esophagitis from food impaction.

Evaluation for heartburn
History of Present Illness:
Tammy Trent is a 55-year-old female with a past medical history of hypothyroidism who presents for evaluation for heartburn and chest pain. She has been having some issues for quite a while. She does have a history of chronic cholecystitis and her gallbladder was removed in 2021. Pathology at that time was consistent with chronic cholecystitis and low-grade dysplasia. He has been having some issues with chest pain. Unclear exactly what seems to make it better or worse. She denies any dysphagia. She has tried omeprazole for about a month without improvement and will often times have to take Rolaids and Tums on top. It is unclear whether any of those make a huge difference. No significant family history of GI disease or malignancy. She has had a cholecystectomy as above in the past.

Assessment:
Tammy Trent is a 55-year-old female with a past medical history of hypothyroidism who presents for evaluation for heartburn and chest pain. Overall, given her chest pain and heartburn symptoms without improvement on PPI, I do think it is reasonable to pursue an EGD to further evaluate. She has apparently had some issues with possible difficult intubation and small airway. Will send a message to her anesthesiologist to evaluate her prior to her case. Otherwise we went over the risks and benefits of the procedure. She has not had issues with anesthesia in the past.

Constipation
History of Present Illness:
The patient reports experiencing significant constipation throughout this year, which has worsened due to ongoing pain management with medications prescribed by their primary care provider, pain specialist, and neurosurgeon. The patient is scheduled for anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) at levels C3 through C6 next week. The constipation has required frequent use of over-the-counter laxatives, but the patient is unsure of their baseline bowel movement frequency without these medications, as they typically resort to laxatives after two or three days without a bowel movement. The patient has a history of grade three hemorrhoids, previously not bothersome, but over the past five to six months has developed rectal bleeding associated with constipation. The patient has never undergone a colonoscopy, despite prior recommendations, due to relocation. The patient is currently on medical leave from work.

Constipation, Abd pain
History of Present Illness:
Ruby Farr is a 54 year old female patient who is seen today for an initial visit for constipation, difficulty with oral intake and weight loss onset June 2025. Patient states that she was in her USOH until she suddenly experienced constipation in which she did not have a bowel movement for a week. She states sx progressed to where she could barely eat and developed significant epigastric pain. She was admitted at Med City North Hills where she underwent inpatient EGD and was told she had ulcers and a hiatal hernia. Was started on Pantoprazole and sucralfate which she has been compliant with. Has also been taking Omeprazole as well. Her epigastric pain has resolved however she is still experiencing constipation despite compliance with Miralax and Benefiber daily. When she goes a week without a bowel movement, she will give herself suppositories and takeDulcolax with relief. She is currently able to tolerate a diet, primarily eating a muffin for breakfast, a chicken or tuna salad for lunch and a small dinner, such as one slice of pizza. She has lost a total of 17 pounds unintentionally since June but attributes this to not being able to eat. She still has intermittent hematochezia, most recently a couple of days ago but states that this is overall improved compared to June when the whole toilet bowl was filled with blood.
She underwent EGD in July 2025 during her admission and per my review of the pictures, it looks like she had Grade B esophagitis and antral gastritis. She does not remember if gastric biopsies were taken. Path report and procedure report not currently available. She also reports she had a CT scan during admission and no obstruction was found. She had colonoscopy in Aug 2025 with note of a very poor bowel prep and incomplete resection of a descending colon polyp in which path revealed tubular adenoma. States she used the Miralax bowel prep and knew that it didn't clean her out completely.
Denies family history of colon cancer. She had been pursuing Cologuards for colon cancer screening prior to her colonoscopy. Ten years ago she had a colonoscopy as she states she had GI problems but does not remember the specifics. Used to drink alcohol socially but has not had any alcohol since June. Denies NSAID use.

Assessment:
Ruby Farr is a 54F who presents for sx most likely related to IBS-C however she did have incomplete resection of a tubular adenoma in the descending colon in Aug 2025 in the context of an inadequate bowel prep. Plan is to proceed with diagnostic colonoscopy at this time with five days of a low residue diet followed by Suprep bowel prep. Will plan to perform DRE prior to procedure while patient is awake. For IBS-C, will start Linzess. If not improvement, will consider ARM/BET. Will obtain records from EGD. Pt reports an ulcer was found. Pending review of records, will consider repeat EGD to evaluate for ulcer healing. Continue Pantoprazole for now. Review of labs from 7/18/25 show normal hgb and TSH and normal liver enzymes.

Diagnoses:
Rectal bleeding (c)
Diarrhea (c)
Constipation
Abdominal pain, epigastric (c,e)
Family history of colon cancer
Acid reflux
History of Clostridioides difficile colitis
Assessment:
1. Abdominal pain and change in bowel habits
- Assessment: The constellation of symptoms including lower abdominal pain, intermittent diarrhea and constipation, and bloating is concerning. The history of partial colectomy, recurrent C. diff infections, and antibiotic use suggests a potential for dysbiosis contributing to her symptoms. Differential diagnoses include IBD (Crohn's, ulcerative colitis), infectious colitis (recurrent C. diff), celiac disease, H. pylori, and functional bowel disorder secondary to dysbiosis or food intolerances.
- Investigations planned:
- Blood work: To be drawn today. Will include serology for celiac disease.
- Stool studies: Kits to be provided today. Will test for a panel of infectious pathogens including C. diff, E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella, as well as parasites. Also for inflammatory markers.
- EGD and Colonoscopy: To be scheduled. Will evaluate the upper GI tract, the remainder of the colon. Biopsies will be taken to rule out IBD, H. pylori, and celiac disease.
- Lifestyle modifications: Discussed the role of food, particularly non-fermentable sugars (FODMAPs) in foods like watermelon, broccoli, cabbage, onions, and garlic, as a potential cause of bloating and spasm if structural and infectious causes are ruled out. The role of stress was also discussed as an amplifier of symptoms.
- Follow-up appointments: A follow-up visit is scheduled for 2-3 weeks after the endoscopic procedures to discuss all results (biopsies, blood work, stool studies) and formulate a definitive management plan together in mutual decision making.
2. Rectal bleeding
- Assessment: The bright red rectal bleeding is likely secondary to internal hemorrhoids, but the possibility of underlying pathology, including malignancy, needs to be excluded, especially given family history of colon cancer and increasing incidence in younger populations.
- Investigations planned: Colonoscopy will be planned for evaluation of above etiologies.
- Medical treatment planned:
- Anusol-HC (hydrocortisone) suppositories prescribed for hemorrhoids, to be used twice daily for 10-14 days. Jessica was counseled to insert a suppository and rest for 20-30 minutes to allow it to dissolve. She will report on its efficacy at the follow-up visit.
- Relevant referrals: If internal hemorrhoids are confirmed on colonoscopy and are refractory to suppositories, a referral will be made to Dr. Cox, colorectal surgeon, for consideration of office-based hemorrhoid banding. Discussed the tiered approach to hemorrhoid treatment: Tier 1 (creams/suppositories), Tier 2 (banding), and Tier 3 (hemorrhoidectomy).

right side pain
hiatal hernia
fatty liver
elevated lft's
gerd
History of Present Illness:
In today's new patient visit, 55 year old female with no known history presents for initial consultation to follow up on gastrointestinal symptoms that have been ongoing for over a year. About a year ago, while in Las Vegas, she reported right upper quadrant pain to her primary care provider. This prompted a series of investigations including an abdominal ultrasound, a HIDA scan, and an upper endoscopy.
The investigations from a year ago revealed several findings. The ultrasound demonstrated hepatic steatosis (fatty liver) but no evidence of cholelithiasis. The HIDA scan showed a significantly diminished and negligible gallbladder ejection fraction, noted to be compatible with chronic cholecystitis or severe gallbladder dysmotility (biliary dyskinesia). The upper endoscopy identified a hiatal hernia. At that time, symptoms included heartburn, gastric reflux, and intermittent right upper quadrant pain. She was advised to take Pepcid (famotidine) on an as-needed basis.
Initially, she used famotidine only occasionally. However, over the past several months, her symptoms have worsened. She now reports needing to take famotidine almost daily, regardless of her dietary intake. She describes experiencing reflux and pain even after consuming bland foods like a sandwich, chips, and yogurt. The pain, which was previously predominantly in the right upper quadrant, is now also experienced in the epigastric region. She reports that symptoms, including reflux and heartburn, can be severe enough to awaken her from sleep. She also notes associated bloating and a sensation of abdominal hardness. The famotidine provides some relief, but she is concerned about the increasing frequency of use and the persistence of her symptoms. She still reports intermittent RUQ pain, but it is not as often as her other symptoms. She denies jaundice or unintentional weight loss.
The patient was seen by a different gastroenterologist previously who reportedly did not address the fatty liver finding and stated that the gallbladder issue was not severe enough to warrant intervention, despite the HIDA scan results. She expresses concern about the fatty liver, particularly after a friend's mother recently passed away from complications of cirrhosis that developed from undiagnosed fatty liver. Recent lab work from her primary care provider has shown persistently elevated liver enzymes, specifically the alkaline phosphatase (ALP). She has not had any repeat imaging since the initial workup a year ago.
A review of her recent and past laboratory results was conducted. A lab report from 09/24/2024 showed an ALP of 140. Another from October 2024 showed an ALP of 131 and an elevated ALT. Her most recent labs showed an ALP of 129, with normal AST and ALT. A GGT level was noted to be elevated at 93 on one report. A hepatitis panel was negative. She also has a history of hypothyroidism, and labs from her endocrinologist were reviewed, which also showed a previously elevated ALP. She denies any history of nausea or vomiting. Bowel movements are reported to be normal for the most part, without any bleeding or other lower abdominal pain.
Her previous colonoscopy had a poor prep, but a subsequent Cologuard test was negative in 2024.

Acid reflux
Assessment:
1. Epigastric pain/heartburn/acid reflux
- Symptoms of heartburn and epigastric pain are worsening, now requiring almost daily use of famotidine. Symptoms occur regardless of diet and can cause nocturnal awakenings.
- EGD in 2024 showed grade 1 esophagitis, sliding medium hiatal hernia
- Will start pantoprazole 40 mg QD to see if symptoms are controlled with PPI therapy.
2. RUQ pain/elevated ALP/biliary dyskinesia
- Severe biliary dyskinesia diagnosed via HIDA scan approximately one year ago, which showed a negligible gallbladder ejection fraction.
- Persistently elevated ALP on multiple lab draws over the past year, with levels ranging from 129 to 140.
- Experiences intermittent right upper quadrant pain, though this is currently less prominent than her epigastric and heartburn symptoms.
- Will order RUQ US to re-assess for cholestatic processes and biliary obstruction causing elevated ALP
- If symptoms persist despite PPI therapy and RUQ US is unremarkable for causes of her pain, will consider elective cholecystectomy for treatment of biliary dyskinesia
3. Fatty liver
- Dx on ultrasound in 2024
- Will re-assess with ultrasound now
- If seen on ultrasound again, will assess further with a Fibroscan for fibrosis
4. Colon CA screening
- Cologuard negative in 2024
- Due for screening colonoscopy in 2027

colon screening consultation
History of Present Illness:
9/8/25
This is a 46-year-old man seen today for a consultation regarding colon cancer screening. Consent was obtained for recording and use of AI scribe software. The patient has never undergone a colonoscopy and reports no family history of colon cancer or colon polyps. He experiences intermittent abdominal bloating, particularly after consuming certain fruits like apples and peaches, but does not report issues with other foods such as greens and whole grains. He has noted sweaty palms, uncertain if related to his hypothyroidism or recent initiation of rosuvastatin. The patient mentions hypothyroidism managed with levothyroxine, which he feels correlates with a need to have a bowel movement shortly after taking the medication. He reports regular bowel movements once or twice a day with no significant constipation, but describes a sensation of incomplete evacuation at times. His weight is stable at around 185 lbs, which he maintains for comfort and to alleviate back pain. There is no change in appetite or significant weight fluctuation noted.
The patient recalls childhood treatments for stomach issues and has had lifelong intermittent bloating. His dietary habits have been adjusted to avoid foods that exacerbate bloating. He reports a history of back pain and ACL surgery, with no issues from previous anesthesia. Blood work has been ordered by Dr. Wolbert, but not yet completed due to concerns about the phlebotomy experience at the prior lab. There is no known family history of colon cancer or colon polyps. The patient’s father has diabetes, and paternal grandmother had cancer, but not colon-related.
- No labs or imaging have been completed yet. The patient expressed a preference for having blood work done at our facility.

Follow-up for elevated liver enzymes after hospital admission for right upper quadrant pain.
History of Present Illness:
Adriana Sanchez is a 32 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit. Admitted to Memorial Hermann Southeast Medical Center with right upper quadrant and epigastric pain. Blood work revealed elevated liver enzymes. Cholecystectomy performed in the past (July 2025). Suspected choledocholithiasis. MRCP was negative for stone but showed a dilated common bile duct, more than expected post-cholecystectomy. Pancreas was normal. Discharged on 08/15/2025 with instructions for follow-up. Last LFTs on 08/15/2025: total bilirubin 0.58, alkaline phosphatase 189, AST 397, ALT 421. MRI also showed fatty liver. Reports current pain has resolved. Also reports long-standing history of heartburn and stomach burning, particularly after eating spicy food. Describes the sensation as a scratch. Has not used any medication for this. Recently, since the cholecystectomy in July 2025, has experienced intermittent dysphagia with solid foods, not liquids. Bowel habits are erratic, alternating between constipation and diarrhea. Denies lower abdominal cramping, blood, or mucus in stool. Does not smoke or drink alcohol. Does not take over-the-counter pain medications.

GERD (e)
Dyspepsia
Fatty liver, non-alcoholic
Liver enzymes abnormal
IBS (irritable bowel syndrome)
Status post cholecystectomy
Assessment:
Seen for follow-up after recent hospitalization for right upper quadrant pain and elevated liver enzymes. The pain has resolved. The working theory was a passed common bile duct stone given the negative MRCP but dilated duct. There are three primary issues to address: 1) Elevated liver enzymes and fatty liver, 2) GERD-like symptoms with new-onset dysphagia, and 3) Irregular bowel habits consistent with IBS.
PLAN:
1. Elevated Liver Enzymes and Fatty Liver [K76.0]
- Repeat liver function tests to check if enzymes have normalized.
- If LFTs remain elevated, will proceed with further blood work to rule out chronic liver disease.
- To investigate the degree of scarring from fatty liver, a FibroScan is ordered. This will be done in Webster.
- Will refer to a clinical trial for fatty liver. Patient counseled that they may be contacted by the trial team.
2. Gastroesophageal Reflux and Dysphagia [K21.9]
- Start pantoprazole 40 mg one tablet daily before breakfast for reflux symptoms.
- Schedule for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to evaluate for underlying pathology, including infection or celiac disease.
- Patient counseled on EGD procedure: must be fasting (NPO) on the day of the procedure and must have a driver to take them home.
3. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) [K58.9]
- Recommends over-the-counter Benefiber powder.
- Instructions: one tablespoon of powder mixed in a large glass of water, to be taken every night to help regulate bowel movements.
4. Referral to chronic care management: GERD, Dyspepsia, Fatty Liver, obesity
Plan:
Adhere to lifestyle and dietary modifications for GERD diet as we discussed. This includes avoiding fatty and greasy foods, fried foods, tomato based foods, caffeine, carbonated drinks, coffee and alcohol. Elevate the head of your bed 6 inches. Additionally, do not eat or drink anything including water within two hours of going to bed at night or 10pm, whichever comes first. Recommend low fat, low cholesterol diet and exercise.

Assessment and Plan
78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease presenting with dysphagia. The patient has persistent dysphagia to both solids and liquids despite previous EGD with dilation, indicating a need for further intervention.
The presence of a Schatzki's ring was noted in past evaluations, which may contribute to the ongoing symptoms. Given the persistence of symptoms, a repeat EGD with a larger dilator is planned, along with esophageal manometry to assess esophageal function.
1. Dysphagia
The patient will undergo an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with dilation using a larger dilator to address the persistent dysphagia. Esophageal manometry will also be performed to evaluate esophageal motility and function. Reflux precautions were discussed with the patient to manage symptoms.
2. Schatzki's Ring
The presence of a Schatzki's ring has been noted in previous evaluations and contributes to the patient's dysphagia. The planned EGD with dilation aims to alleviate the obstruction caused by the ring.
3. Coronary Artery Disease
The patient's coronary artery disease is stable, and he is currently on Xarelto for anticoagulation. Xarelto will be held for two days prior to the procedure to minimize bleeding risk.
Plan:
EGD with dilation as needed with Anesthesia Provider/CRNA who is hereby directed and authorized to administer anesthesia - 43249
Risks and benefits statement: The procedure and its preparation, benefits, alternatives, and limitations were explained to the patient or legal guardian. The risks and potential complications including but not limited to perforation, bleeding, infection, missed lesion, aspiration and other complications of sedation were reviewed.

epigastric pain and constipation
History of Present Illness:
Audrey Dromgoole is a 68-year-old here today for a follow-up appointment. I saw her in a new patient visit in February 2025 and soon thereafter for an EGD/colonoscopy.
History of epigastric pain and constipation.
She states that she continues to experience abd pain and bloating. She had CT scan done at STRIC one week ago which showed some type of blood clot in the liver.   She is moving her bowels several times a day with formed to loose stools.  There is no blood in the stool.
She is still taking omeprazole once a day which she thinks helps to some degree.
She has had bad indigestion and belching.
Available workup:
CT AP w/wo contrast STRIC Sept 3, 2025 nothing acute.  left lobe of liver with severe atrophy with probable left PV thrombosis, NEW since prior study in 2016.
EGD/colonoscopy February 2025 findings 1 cm hiatal hernia, gastritis, grade 1 internal hemorrhoids, sigmoid diverticulosis and a 10 mm cecal tubular adenoma. 3-year surveillance colonoscopy recommended. Gastric biopsy showed mild chronic gastritis negative for HP, duodenal biopsies were normal and negative for celiac disease.
Labs January 2025 H. pylori breath test not detected
WBC 9.9, hemoglobin 14, hematocrit 44, MCV 90, platelets 371,000, CMP normal, lipase 27
EGD/colonoscopy July 2016 Dr. Espinoza findings clean-based antral ulcer, extensive gastritis, internal hemorrhoids, colonic diverticulosis but no polyps. 2-month follow-up EGD recommended. Pathology showed reactive foveolar gland hyperplasia with mild edema, inactive chronic gastritis negative for IM or HP. 10-year screening colonoscopy July 2026

Abnormal CT scan, gastrointestinal tract
Assessment:
Epigastric pain: She continues to experience abd bloating and pain. A CT scan was done last week and per the pt, showed some type of vascular abnl.   It is unclear of the abdominal pain complaints she has been experiencing are related to the abnormality seen on CT scan which show a probable left portal vein thrombosis. It is however possible that she may suffer from a hypercoagulable disease and as such, she has been referred for hematology evaluation. For now, I will treat her with an antispasmodic to see if some of her symptoms may be functional in nature.  .
Change in bowel habits/constipation:   bowels are moving several times a day with loose non bloody stools. Trial bentyl
left hepatic lobe atrophy with probable Left portal vein thrombosis. Will initiate workup with labs, MRI liver and referral to hematology for possible hypercoagulable workup. There is no antecedent liver disease.  Her brother suffers from advanced liver disease/he doesnt drink..

6 weeks follow up, change in bowel habits
History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 59-year-old gentleman who was last seen in November 2022 for his colonoscopy which was normal. Repeat recommended in 5 years given personal history of colon polyps and family history of colon cancer.
Patient is a 59-year-old gentleman with a history of colon polyps and family history of colon cancer who was last seen in August 2025 with complaints of diarrhea, intermittent nausea, abdominal cramping, unintentional weight loss.
Since the patient was last seen, his breath test for SIBO was positive. Xifaxan was called into his pharmacy on 8/19. TSH, calprotectin, celiac antibodies, fecal elastase, C. difficile, ova and parasites negative. Abdominal ultrasound showed possible hepatic steatosis. Had FibroScan in 9/3/2025.
Patient presents today for follow-up visit accompanied by his wife. He completed his course of Xifaxan 3 days ago. He states his diarrhea has resolved but he continues with stomach gurgling and bloating. He is concerned about the color of his stools being yellow rather than brown. He denies any abdominal pain, blood in stools, melena or fevers. He has gained weight since his last visit. We do not yet have FibroScan results but he was told the numbers were 311 and 7.4.

Assessment:
The natural history, pathophysiology and treatment of SIBO was reviewed with the patient. Patient completed his course of Xifaxan 3 days ago. We discussed giving it an additional 2 weeks to see if it takes more effect. If he continues with his symptoms after 2 weeks, he will take a course of Augmentin for second-line treatment. A low-carb diet was recommended to prevent symptom recurrence. Patient agrees with the plan.
The natural history, pathophysiology and treatment of fatty liver was reviewed with the patient. Weight loss, diet, exercise, avoidance of alcohol and tobacco as well as aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors were reinforced. I will check an MRI liver elastography for further evaluation of hepatic fibrosis. He will follow-up with me in 1 month to review results. We reviewed his abdominal ultrasound and discussed that his gallbladder looked normal. I will check LFTs for further evaluation.

Chronic HBV
LPR
History of Present Illness:
Kyoko Dillman  is a 77 year old   female  who is seen today for a follow-up visit. PMHx: Hepatitis B stage II, osteopenia, sleep apnea, former smoker, chronic leukopenia, multiple family member with hepatitis B and brother with cirrhosis, LPR.
The patient is here for follow-up after recent labs and ultrasound. She has a history of chronic hepatitis B and is currently maintained on daily Entecavir. Since her last visit, she was evaluated by ENT and diagnosed with laryngopharyngeal reflux. Referred for voice therapy, but this did not provide additional benefit. Responding well to famotidine 40 mg daily, with resolution of cough and hoarseness of voice. Alcohol use only on special occasions. The patient again declined colonoscopy and prefers to continue with Cologuard screening, which was completed last year and was negative.
Her creatinine continues to rise on recent labs. She has seen nephrology follow-up many years ago but has not seen nephrology recently.

abnormal LFT's
History of Present Illness:
Very pleasant 74-year-old female here today for consultation regarding abnormal LFTs. Apparently this is going on for many years but lately is worsening again. She is to see our partner Dr. Harrison several years ago. She then underwent a liver biopsy which was essentially normal with benign liver with mild lipofuscin pigmentation. FibroScan was also negative for fatty liver or scarring. She does also report chronic epigastric and right upper quadrant pain episodes that will occur in discrete episodes and be rather severe when they occur. These began after her gallbladder and gastric bypass surgery in 2004. She has had workup for this in the past that was negative. She denies any jaundice or icterus. She also did have a colonoscopy last year apparently with a large piecemeal polypectomy and was recommended to have a follow-up in 3 years.

Abnormal LFTs
Assessment:
I will request records from PCM to see what her LFTs have done in the past. I will run full liver serologies now. Interestingly she had a prior history of elevated LFTs with a liver biopsy that was normal and FibroScan that was normal as well. 1 possibility I would consider is given the episodes of pain that she is having along with the intermittently elevated LFTs would be SOD. She had a pain attack on Monday. So I plan to check LFTs today. If they are normal I will have her draw another CMP in the future after a pain attack. If they are elevated today I will repeat them in a week or 2 to see if they normalize quickly. Otherwise I will schedule an ultrasound and a FibroScan. She will be due for a surveillance colonoscopy in 2027.

abnormal LFT's
History of Present Illness:
Very pleasant 74-year-old female here today for consultation regarding abnormal LFTs. Apparently this is going on for many years but lately is worsening again. She is to see our partner Dr. Harrison several years ago. She then underwent a liver biopsy which was essentially normal with benign liver with mild lipofuscin pigmentation. FibroScan was also negative for fatty liver or scarring. She does also report chronic epigastric and right upper quadrant pain episodes that will occur in discrete episodes and be rather severe when they occur. These began after her gallbladder and gastric bypass surgery in 2004. She has had workup for this in the past that was negative. She denies any jaundice or icterus. She also did have a colonoscopy last year apparently with a large piecemeal polypectomy and was recommended to have a follow-up in 3 years.

UC
History of Present Illness:
42 y/o F with ulcerative colitis on Humira, transferring care from Wichita Falls. She has not been seen in TDDC previously.  She has developing red/painful swelling of the superior/anterior aspect of the lower left leg since this summer.  It started at her ankle and has migrated up the leg since then.  This is tender and unpleasant.  She was originally diagnoses in 2016 at age 33.  She had a colonoscopy at that time showing UC.  In 2019, she had another colonoscopy.  A small rectal carcinoid was removed at the follow up colonoscopy in 2020.  In 2023, another colonoscopy was reportedly normal, per her memory.  She was having some left flank pain last year, and a CT was reportedly unremarkable.  That pain went away on its own. She has been on humira 40mg every other week since 2016.  She reports that bowel movements are normal.  No hematochezia, diarrhea, or urgency.

Assessment:
42 y/o F with ulcerative colitis on Humira, transferring care from Wichita Falls. She has not been seen in TDDC previously.  She has developed erythema nodosum.  I can't tell for sure if that's because she now has subclinical Crohn's Disease, or if she has a UC flare without her typical symptoms, or if she is having a reaction from the Humira itself.  In any of those cases, the treatment of choice would be switching her medications.  Discussed a variety of options, and she would like to try Rinvoq.  Labs ordered today.  Will check humira Ab to look for evidence of immunogenicity.  May need to avoid TNF-alpha class for now while Humira is in question.  Pre-biologic labs ordered.  Switch advil to celebrex.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. Clifton is a 68-year-old female seen today due to a change in her bowel movements and abdominal pain. About 2 months ago she started noticing more constipation. She saw her PCP who prescribed her lactulose but states that she took multiple doses without any relief. She is also complaining of increased diffuse abdominal pain and abdominal bloating. She did go to the emergency room last month Due to significant bloating with associated nausea and vomiting. she had a CT scan of her abdomen and pelvis. CT showed mild wall thickening and stranding of the proximal sigmoid colon suggesting localized colitis, infectious or inflammatory favored over neoplastic. She has been taking fiber supplements, stool softeners, and laxatives and has been having more bowel movements although she states it is small in amount. She denies any blood in her stool. She does have a personal history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and follows with oncology. She has never had a colonoscopy done before. She does not have a family history of colon cancer or colon polyps. She does not have any upper GI complaints at this time.

Hospital Follow Up
History of Present Illness:
Cordelia Bailey is a 82 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit.  This is a follow-up visit for Cordelia Bailey regarding a recent hospitalization for acute pancreatitis. The patient was seen in the hospital on 08/13/2025, at which time they were diagnosed with acute pancreatitis and a pancreatic pseudocyst. There was also a dilated pancreatic duct and intrapancreatic ductal system noted. The gallbladder was surgically removed during that admission as it was suspected to be the cause of the pancreatitis. Currently, the patient reports feeling well and that the pain has completely resolved. They are active and walk between 6,000 and 9,000 steps per day. The patient no longer experiences acid reflux and is managing this with diet alone, without medication. There is no longer any constipation; however, they now experience some diarrhea and fecal urgency. The urgency varies depending on the time of day and dietary intake. The patient reports attempting to eat a healthier diet but does not wish to eliminate meat entirely. The patient denies hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, odynophagia, unexplained weight loss, fever, and chills. An abdominal ultrasound was performed on 08/13/2025. A subsequent magnetic resonance imaging scan was performed to rule out stones in the bile duct, and this was negative. The imaging did show a pancreas with significant inflammatory changes and the development of cysts, presumed to be pseudocysts secondary to the pancreatitis. The past medical history is significant for acute pancreatitis in August 2025, cholecystectomy in August 2025, acid reflux, and constipation, which has resolved.

Abdominal pain, epigastric (e)-resolved
GERD (e)
Constipation-resolved
Assessment:
Discussed in detail with the patient regarding their CT-Abdomen/Pelvis results. Discussed in detail with the patient regarding their MRI/MRCP results. Discussed in detail with the patient regarding ultrasound results. Discussed in detail with patient lab results. I have discussed with patient in detail the current diagnosis and differential diagnosis.
1. Acute pancreatitis, K85.90
- assessment: resolved.
- Investigations planned for Issue 1: A repeat magnetic resonance imaging scan of the pancreas will be ordered in approximately one month to monitor the pseudocysts and ensure they are shrinking, and to rule out true cysts which carry a cancer potential. The patient was counseled that a computed tomography scan is an alternative but has more radiation exposure. A complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel will also be performed.
- Treatment planned for Issue 1: The current plan is observation, as the patient is asymptomatic and the pseudocysts are expected to resolve over several months.
- List medications prescribed or discussed, with instructions: No new medications were prescribed.
2. Diarrhea, R19.7
- assessment: likely post-cholecystectomy diarrhea.
- Treatment planned for Issue 2: Continue to monitor symptoms.
- List medications prescribed or discussed, with instructions: No new medications were prescribed.
3. Pancreatic pseudocyst, K86.3
- assessment: pancreatic pseudocyst.
- Investigations planned for Issue 3: A repeat magnetic resonance imaging scan will be performed in approximately one month.
- Treatment planned for Issue 3: We will continue to monitor with the expectation that these will resolve spontaneously over time.
- List medications prescribed or discussed, with instructions: No new medications were prescribed.
A follow-up appointment is scheduled in approximately two months to review the results of the laboratory work and imaging, and to ensure continued recovery. The patient was informed that the purpose of surveillance is to ensure the pseudocysts, thought to be from inflammation, are resolving. It was explained that this process can take several months. An order for a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel was placed, and the patient was given a requisition. The process to obtain pre-authorization for the magnetic resonance imaging scan was explained.
Plan:
Continue current medications
GERD diet, education provided
Complete Blood Count (CBC) with Diff
Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)
MRI Abdomen/Attention: Pancreas/With and WITHOUT contrast - 74183
Follow-up office visit in 2 months
Additional Notes:
The level of service for this established patient visit is determined to be a level 4 (99214). The medical decision making was of moderate complexity. This was a follow-up visit for a patient with a recent hospitalization for acute pancreatitis with a complication of a pancreatic pseudocyst. The assessment and plan involved reviewing past imaging, ordering new imaging (magnetic resonance imaging), ordering laboratory tests, and discussing the natural history and potential risks, including the small possibility of the cysts being true cysts with malignant potential. The management of these problems required a detailed discussion and coordination of further diagnostic studies, justifying a moderate level of complexity."

Assessment:
Terry Williams is a 78F who presents with acute on chronic constipation, which is most likely exacerbated by decreased mobility after she suffered from a fall in May 2025 and her mobility has significantly decreased. Conservative OTC measures have not provided relief except for enemas. Fecal impaction was manually disrupted in clinic today but was quite proximal however a small amount of light brown stool was able to be extracted. Discussed with patient's son who states he will try to do an enema at home today. Will send in prescription for Golytely bowel prep to manage this acute exacerbation. Pt and son instructed that she does not have to finish the entire gallon if she is having bowel movements and feeling better. Will also start Linzess 72 mcg daily given lack of response to conservative management. Encouraged 64 oz of water daily however we discussed that constipation may continue to be a recurring problem especially with her mobility status and she may need enemas PRN. Pt's son verbalizes understanding. Will also obtain CT scan and proceed with diagnostic colonoscopy. I will need records from most recent lab work, medication list and recent hospitalizations prior to proceeding with colonoscopy. Will also need to obtain cardiac clearance prior to colonoscopy. ED precautions discussed including but not limited to worsening abdominal pain, fevers, progressive nausea/vomiting, blood in stool. Pt and son verbalize understanding.
Plan:
Golytely 236-22.74-6.74-5.86 gram Drink 1 kit by mouth split dose as directed for colonoscopy prep

Follow Up EGD, Ultrasound
History of Present Illness:
Shaylin Longoria is a 25 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit. This is a follow-up for a 25-year-old female previously evaluated on 08/20/2025 for lower abdominal pain with alternating constipation and diarrhea.
The primary complaint today is isolated nausea, which has been present since the age of 11. The nausea is somewhat improved today. It occurs approximately once daily, typically in the morning and mid-afternoon. Taking ondansetron helps alleviate the symptom. There is a history of being sick at age 11, potentially due to reflux, and a proton pump inhibitor was trialed at that time, but the effectiveness is not recalled.
The right-sided abdominal pain persists; however, the location has changed. It was previously in the right upper quadrant and has recently shifted to the right lower quadrant, with the pain alternating between these two locations. The pain occurs approximately three to four times per week, lasts for about three minutes, and is described as a sharp ache. Rubbing the area provides some relief. The severity has decreased since its onset in August, now rated as a three out of ten. There is no prior history of similar pain.
Symptoms of reflux are reported approximately three times per week, occurring mainly at night.
The previously reported alternating constipation and diarrhea has resolved, and there is now only constipation. Bowel movements occur every three days with hard stools. This is possibly exacerbated by the use of ondansetron.
The review of systems is negative for hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, diarrhea, vomiting, dysphagia, odynophagia, fecal urgency, unexplained weight loss, fever, and chills. Nausea and constipation are present as noted above.
An upper endoscopy performed on 08/22/2025 revealed non-erosive gastritis. Pathology was negative for celiac disease and Helicobacter pylori but was positive for reactive gastropathy. An abdominal ultrasound on 08/21/2025 was unremarkable, showing no evidence of gallstones or biliary ductal dilation. A complete blood count from 08/20/2025 showed an elevated white blood cell count of 12,000 cells per microliter and elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit of 15.7 g/dL and 47% respectively, suggesting possible dehydration. Repeat laboratory studies on 08/25/2025 were within normal limits. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis performed in the emergency room in mid-August was unremarkable, showing only a small amount of physiologic free fluid in the pelvis.
The past medical history is significant for non-erosive gastritis and reactive gastropathy.
PAST SUMMARY: 08/20/2025
Shaylin Longoria is a 25 year old female patient who is seen today for an initial visit. The individual presents for evaluation of lifelong stomach issues, characterized by persistent nausea and an upset stomach, described as a queasy and nervous sensation, which has been thought to be associated with a history of anxiety. The symptoms acutely worsened approximately one week ago, last Monday, with the onset of significant nausea that prevented the ability to eat or drink anything. Over the past two days, there has been a slight improvement, with the ability to consume small amounts of solid food. This recent episode prompted two visits to the emergency room, where no definitive cause was identified.
The recent episode was associated with mild, sharp, right lower quadrant abdominal pain. There was also a poor appetite and an associated symptom of experiencing white flashes upon standing up. The nausea is exacerbated by sweet foods, with a current tolerance limited to vegetables and similar items. There has been no vomiting associated with this recent episode. The individual reports a history of both constipation and diarrhea, which are equally bothersome. These symptoms have been present since childhood and have occurred long before any history of marijuana use, which has been discontinued for some time. The chronic nature of these symptoms has a significant impact on daily life.
The individual denies hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, dysphagia, odynophagia, fecal urgency, unexplained weight loss, fever, and chills.
Laboratory studies from 08/16/2025 at HCA Clear Lake revealed a normal lipase level and a normal magnesium level. The basic metabolic panel was unremarkable, with normal kidney function, electrolytes, and blood glucose levels. There was a mild elevation in the white blood cell count to 11.3, which could be indicative of a transient infection or dehydration. The liver panel was normal. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis performed on the same date showed a small amount of pelvic fluid, which was considered likely physiologic and not a cause for alarm.
The past medical history is significant for anxiety. The individual has a history of marijuana use but reports not having used it for a while.

Assessment:
Discussed in detail with the patient regarding EGD results. Discussed in detail with the patient regarding pathology results. Discussed in detail with patient lab results. I have discussed with patient in detail the current diagnosis and differential diagnosis. Discussed in detail with the patient regarding ultrasound results.
1. Gastroesophageal reflux disease, K21.9
- Assessment: Gastroesophageal reflux disease
- Investigations planned for Issue 1: None at this time.
- Treatment planned for Issue 1: A trial of omeprazole for two weeks was recommended. The GERD diet was reviewed and discussed.
- List medications prescribed or discussed, with instructions: Omeprazole 20 milligrams once daily. She was counseled on the potential side effects of proton pump inhibitors.
2. Abdominal pain, R10.9
- Assessment: Nonspecific abdominal pain
- Investigations planned for Issue 2: A hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid scan with cholecystokinin stimulation was offered to evaluate for gallbladder dysfunction if right upper quadrant pain persists. A colonoscopy was offered to evaluate the colon as a source of the new right lower quadrant pain. She has deferred further testing at this time to first see if regulating bowel movements improves the pain.
- Treatment planned for Issue 2: She will continue a high-fiber diet and increase water intake. She was advised to minimize the use of ondansetron due to its constipating effects. The option for over-the-counter or prescribed stool softeners was discussed if needed. She declined medications for constipation at this time.
3. Nausea, R11.0
- Assessment: Nausea
- Treatment planned for Issue 3: The nausea may be related to poorly controlled reflux, and it will be reassessed after a trial of omeprazole. The importance of not relying on nausea medication long-term was discussed. She declined a trial of metoclopramide.
Shaylin Longoria is a 25-year-old female here for a follow-up of abdominal pain, nausea, and altered bowel habits. Her upper endoscopy and abdominal ultrasound were largely unremarkable, showing only mild, non-specific gastritis. The thought is that her initial severe symptoms may have been related to an acute infectious process, such as gastroenteritis, with associated dehydration, from which she is having a prolonged recovery. The current plan is to address her reflux symptoms with omeprazole, as this may also be contributing to her nausea. She will also focus on managing constipation with a high-fiber diet and increased fluid intake to see if this alleviates her lower abdominal pain. Further diagnostic testing, including a hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid scan and colonoscopy, were offered but she has chosen to defer these for now. We will re-evaluate in approximately six weeks.
Plan:
omeprazole 20 mg Take 1 capsule by mouth once a day, 30 minutes before the first meal of the day
High fiber diet, education provided
Continue current medications
GERD diet, education provided
Potential side effects of a PPI were discussed with patient regarding long-term safety.
Follow-up office visit in 6 weeks
Politely declined bowel regimen at this moment.

Colorectal first visit- rectal pain x 6 months
Referral from Sean Neufeldt
History of Present Illness:
Ayman Alasad is a 49 year old male patient who is seen today for an initial visit.
This is a 49-year-old male patient here to see me for evaluation of anorectal pain. He presents with a six-month history of constant rectal pain, which he describes as a burning or stabbing sensation. The pain is present at rest, rated as 5/10, and feels slightly worse on the left side. It is exacerbated by prolonged sitting but only slightly worsens with bowel movements.
He reports a history of hemorrhoids since age 17. He underwent a hemorrhoidectomy in 1997. Following the procedure, he had intermittent prolapsing hemorrhoids requiring manual reduction. In 2019, he underwent a colonoscopy with Dr. Olson for increased pain, at which time he had hemorrhoidal banding performed. The procedure provided relief for approximately two years. The hemorrhoids began to prolapse again about two and a half years ago, but this was painless until the onset of the current pain six months ago. He notes that in the past, he experienced some bleeding associated with the prolapse about a year ago, but denies any recent or significant bleeding. He denies constipation, abdominal pain, pencil-thin stools, or unintentional weight loss. He reports adherence to a high-fiber diet and good bowel habits, spending only 1 to 2 minutes on the toilet per bowel movement. He denies a history of anemia.
His past medical history is significant for hemorrhoids. His past surgical history includes a hemorrhoidectomy in 1997. He had a colonoscopy with hemorrhoidal banding in 2019, which was otherwise normal.
Test results reviewed:
He reports having done a Cologuard test recently which he reports was negative. The 2019 colonoscopy report was reviewed and noted to be normal, with a recommendation for a repeat in 10 years (2029).
Physical exam:
External anorectal inspection reveals a chronic posterior midline anal fissure with associated scar tissue. There was no internal examination performed due to anticipated severe pain.

Diagnosis:
Chronic posterior anal fissure
Colon cancer screening
Assessment:
1. Chronic Anal Fissure: The clinical presentation of burning, stabbing rectal pain at rest, exacerbated by sitting, in combination with the physical exam finding of a chronic-appearing posterior midline fissure with scar tissue, is consistent with this diagnosis. The pain is likely attributable to the fissure itself and associated hypertonicity of the internal anal sphincter muscle.
Plan:
- A trial of medical management is initiated.
- A colonoscopy is recommended in approximately four weeks to fully evaluate the anorectal canal, assess for underlying hemorrhoidal disease, and perform colorectal cancer screening. This will also serve as a follow-up to assess his response to medical therapy. He will be traveling for three to four months starting in four weeks, and we will attempt to schedule the procedure before his departure.
- The risks and benefits, preparation, and procedural details were discussed and any questions were answered.
- Medical treatment planned: Nifedipine ointment, a compounded calcium channel blocker, to be applied as a pea-sized amount to the external anal area three times daily. This is intended to increase local blood flow and relax the internal anal sphincter to promote healing. The prescription will be sent to Daniel Drug.
- Lifestyle modifications: Recommended to take warm sitz baths for 10 to 15 minutes, 2-3 times per day to help relax the anal sphincter muscle and increase blood flow. He is to continue his current high-fiber diet and avoidance of straining.
- Follow-up appointments: He will follow up for a colonoscopy in approximately four weeks. If he is not improved, surgical intervention including fissurectomy with Botox injection will be considered.
Plan:
Colonoscopy with Anesthesia Provider/CRNA who is hereby directed and authorized to administer anesthesia - 45378
Additional Notes:
After Visit Summary:
- Your visit today was for rectal pain. The examination showed that you have a chronic anal fissure. This is a non-healing wound that is causing your pain, likely due to muscle spasms
- We will start with medical treatment to try and heal the fissure. This includes a special compounded ointment and warm baths.
- Nifedipine ointment: Please apply a pea-sized amount of this ointment to the outside of your anal area three times a day. We have sent the prescription to a compounding pharmacy called Daniel Drug, and they will have it ready for you. This medication may take about two weeks to start working.
- Sitz Baths: Please soak in a warm to hot bathtub for 10-15 minutes at least twice a day. This helps relax the muscles and improves blood flow to help with healing. You do not need to add Epsom salts unless you find it makes you feel better.
- Diet: Continue your excellent high-fiber diet and habits of avoiding straining or long periods on the toilet.
- We also discussed having a colonoscopy in about 2-4 weeks, before you leave for your travels. This will allow us to examine the area fully under sedation, check on your hemorrhoids, and make sure your colon is healthy. If you cannot have a colonoscopy before your travels, we would like to see you in the office before you leave."

Was in remission in 6 week interval of entyvio. He self dc-ed due to personal issues. Was drinking a lot of etoh and stopped but he is completely etoh free.  A lot of bloating. Lost weight, about 8 lbs in a few weeks. Not formed stools, fully runny at times. 4-5 times per day. Last colon was years ago, no record. Last treatment 4-5 years ago. No bleeding. He thinks crohns was just in colon. ALT was very elevated in July. Hasn't drank since last year. Exercise is 45 min of walking dog.
