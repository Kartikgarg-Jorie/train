History of Present Illness:
Shawn Blanchard is a 46 year old male who is seen today for a follow-up visit. Last visit 03/07/2025 after this he had ultrasound 3/2025 and fibroscan 5/2025 consistent with fatty liver - reviewed with patient today. He continues famotidine daily which he feels has helped upper symptoms about 80%. He continues to have occasional heartburn and belching. Denies true regurgitation, nausea, dysphagia, or vomiting. He has abdominal burning and admits to having surgical opinion about a month ago in Gonzales with Dr Manneli who did not feel surgery was warranted and he was diagnosed with Diastasis recti. He continues humira every other week but admits he was switched to biosimilar Simlandi about 6 weeks ago and symptoms have remained at baseline. He is currently having soft and formed bowel movements that can alternate with diarrhea and most days he goes to the restroom 4-5 times a day. He remains on colestipol BID - but  is unsure if this is helping. He has done xifaxin in the past with temporary results. Denies fecal incontinence or nocturnal stooling. He can see small amount of bright red blood with wiping which he attributes to intermittent hemorrhoid flares - denies currently. Denies melena, acholic stools, or unexplained weight loss.
Patient was originally diagnosed with Ulcerative colitis around 2003 with Dr Rao but then diagnosis was changed to Crohn's around 2016. He was originally on various mesalamines long term but was switched to humira every other week around 2016/2017 which he has been on since. He had SBO with ileocecal resection in Baton Rouge with Dr Barfield 2/2023 with pathology that revealed a small neuroendocrine tumor and he has been following Dr Du Since this. He admits he is overdue for follow up with Dr Du who he is supposed to follow every 6 months. Last visit with Dr Du 3/2025 with CT imaging. Prior CT 11/2024 with thickened small bowel loops left upper quadrant suggestive of enteritis, focal small bowel intussusception likely transient. Stool studies and labs 1/2025, drug levels and MRI enterography 2/2025. He took short course of steroids 2/2025 which helped his chronic GI symptoms some, no steroids since. Denies recent abx or sick exposures. He is due for repeat Colonoscopy 10/2025. He has never had an EGD. Denies lung or kidney disease. He is on baby aspirin.

History of Present Illness:
Chester Vegas is a 82 year old male who is seen today for a follow-up visit. Last visit 06/06/2025. He presents today with continued complaints of intermittent diarrhea and bloating. He has most recently started oral mesalamine 3 daily which he initially felt helped and then he lost response. Recent stool studies ordered with c-diff negative, stool culture negative, and fecal calprotectin never received (it appears fecal fat was run instead with total fat increase, neutral fat normal) - reviewed all with patient and wife. He has previously tried and failed colestipol and did not tolerate MiraLAX. Partial response to pepto and Imodium. He is currently having 3-4 bowel movements a day most days, on less common occasion he can have up to 4-5 bowel movements a day and can also on rare occasion go up to 2-3 days without a bowel movement. Stools can vary in consistency from loose and watery, semiformed and on less occasion soft and formed. He did not feel fiber helped in the past but admits to recently restarting this over the past couple of days and does feel like he has had some response this time. Denies overt GI bleeding, acholic stools, mucous in stool, fever. He has intermittent generalized abdominal cramping which could be worse postprandially and sometimes with or prior to defecation. Denies dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, GERD symptoms remain under control on pantoprazole. Weight is stable. He remains on plavix, ezetimibe, and aspirin. Denies NSAID Use. He continues to smoke 6-7 cigs/day. Denies alcohol use. CT 9/2024. Stool studies 11/2024 ok (other than fecal cal 135). CT and labs 9/2024. VCE and EGD 2019. Colonoscopy 2017. Due to his age and comorbidities, he would still like to avoid endoscopic workup if possible. Recent apptmt with Dr Vander and kidney function has declined more and Dr Vander has concerns that patient's bowel habits could be a contributing factor. He will have upcoming repeat labs to recheck this. He does not have his gallbladder.

422,9/15/2025,1883288,99214,R94.5,K21.9,K86.2,Z12.11,"Chief Complaint:	Abnormal liver profile
History of Present Illness:
56-year-old lady who I saw in consultation for Fatty liver.
She had blood tests done prior to starting on Wegovy 1 year ago which apparently revealed abnormal liver profile. The plan was to monitor the response of this to weight loss on the Wegovy but despite losing 80 pounds the liver profile is persistently abnormal. She does not know whether current results are better. No family history of liver disease. No history of alcohol excess, intravenous drug use or tattoos. No blood transfusions. No prior abnormal liver profile. Works as a process engineer. Is not on any other new medications. Takes fish oil, co-Q10, vitamin E, vitamin D, niacin 500 mg once a day and DIM. Does not have any history of hypertriglyceridemia. Not diabetic.
On omeprazole 40 mg nightly her heartburn was under good control. She reduced this to 20 mg nightly about 2 weeks ago. She does not have any heartburn at this time but was having it all through the day and night in the past. It is more often in the evening and night. Has never tried Pepcid. No nausea, vomiting or dysphagia. Has loss of appetite on the Wegovy. No abdominal pain.
Bowels move every other day. No blood in the stool or black stool. No family history of colon cancer.
6/2018 colonoscopy revealed 5 mm rectal polyp and 7 mm sigmoid polyp. Both were hyperplastic. Internal hemorrhoids.
5/20/2024 CMP was normal apart from AST 85 and ALT 161. TSH 1.305. Ferritin 111. CBC was normal. Vitamin D 35. Cholesterol 246. Triglycerides 108. Hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody were negative. ANA was negative.
10/21/2024
8/22/2024 right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed changes consistent with cholecystectomy. Liver was of normal texture and echogenicity.
FibroScan did not reveal any evidence of liver fibrosis.
She did not get the blood work done that I had requested at the last visit. On the Pepcid 20 mg nightly she was having heartburn in the evening and at night. The symptoms improved when she resumed the omeprazole 20 mg after dinner. Denies any nausea, vomiting or dysphagia.
She has mild discomfort in the right upper quadrant of her abdomen which is constant. When she is busy she is not aware of it. Discomfort is localized to this area and there are no specific aggravating or relieving factors. No associated symptoms. The intensity is 1-2 out of 10.
Her bowels are regular without any recent change in bowel habit. No blood in the stool or black stool.
12/31/2024
11/6/2024 liver profile was normal apart from AST 96 and ALT 152. Acute hepatitis profile was normal. Celiac profile was normal. Iron saturation 42%. Hemoglobin A1c 4.8. Actin antibody and M2 antibody were negative. Copper and ceruloplasmin were normal. Alpha-1 antitrypsin was normal.
11/11/2024 MRI abdomen with and without contrast was reported as no discrete lesions or adenopathy is observed. Delayed enhancing lesion in the medial spleen consistent with a small hemangioma. Hemorrhagic or proteinaceous cyst seen in the anterior left kidney. Nonspecific 0.5 cm cystic lesion in the head of the pancreas. Recommend 2-year follow-up MRI/MRCP to ensure stability.
She has gained 12 pounds since the last visit as she has not been able to get her Wegovy. On the omeprazole 20 mg every afternoon she does not have any heartburn. Denies any nausea, vomiting or dysphagia. The right upper quadrant abdominal pain has resolved
Bowels are regular without any recent change in bowel habit although eating unhealthy over Thanksgiving and Christmas she has constipation now. She has  increased her water and fiber intake to help regularize her bowel habit.
4/29/2025
1/31/2025 CBC was normal. CMP was normal apart from creatinine 1.03, chloride 95, AST 77 and ALT 63.
2/26/2025 liver biopsy revealed hepatic parenchyma with features of resolving injury.
In December and January she stopped the Wegovy causing her to gain the 12 pounds. Since then she has lost 5 pounds which she attributes to resumption of the Wegovy. No nausea, vomiting or dysphagia.
She ran out of the omeprazole and since then she has been having heartburn around bedtime. She normally takes it around 930 pm. She does not usually eat supper.
The abdominal pain is infrequent. Bowels are regular without any recent change in bowel habit. No blood in the stool or black stool.
9/15/2025
4/29/25 hepatic function panel was normal apart from ALT 67, normal 6-29.
She has gained 4 pounds since the last visit despite being on Wegovy which she attributes to stress eating from stress at work. The right upper quadrant abdominal discomfort has resolved. Denies any nausea, vomiting or dysphagia. She does not have any heartburn on the omeprazole 20 mg before dinner.
Bowels are regular without any recent change in bowel habit. No blood in the stool or black stool.

Reena Cruz  is a 35 year old   female  who is seen today for a follow-up visit on constipation and bloating. Pt's bloating has improved since her previous visit. They have stopped benefiber as they did not find any benefit with this. Pt is having a bowel movement every 2 days after utilizing enemas, and mom reports use of digital maneuvers/stimulation on occasion to help her defecate. She continues to be on Linzess 290mcg daily. Pt's parent states that her bowel movements that are soft or loose, and never hard. Pt is not utilizing a low FODMAP diet nor Mg supplements. She is not is having black tarry stools, blood in stools, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.

Reena Cruz  is a 36 year old   female  who is seen today for a follow-up visit on constipation and increased flatulence. Pt presents with her parents who is providing her history. Pt's mother states that pt has had increased symptoms since starting her menstrual cycle in September, which has resulted in increased irritation and overall discomfort. Pt's parents are concerned that her bowel habits are not regular enough and may be resulting increased irritability. Pt has been getting Linzess 290mcg daily, but pt's parents admit to improper administration as she is taking this with food and occasionally with dairy. Pt is still utilizing an enema every other day to help have bowel movements, but notes that there are time where no stool is evacuated with the enemas and only gas is released. Pt's stools are loose when she does have a bowel movement. She is not is having black tarry stools, blood in stools, nausea, vomiting, or unintentional weight loss. Of note, pt's parents were attempting to ween pt off her anti-epileptics, which resulted in a break through seizure last month. She is now working with a new neurologist and recently started on several new medications, which have also seemed to worsen her mood. Her diet has remained stable with limited sources of fiber. Pt had presented to the ER a few times where a CT A/P had been completed that was unremarkable. Lastly, pt's parents had inquired about possible colonoscopy or endoscopy.

Reena Cruz is a 36 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit on constipation, increased flatulence and GERD. Patient's mother D/C once has on April 1, which she has follow-up has significantly alleviated patient's abdominal bloating and flatulence. They are now utilizing prune juice daily along with a saline enema every 2 days with successful bowel movements that are easy to evacuate. She is no longer having excess flatulence or seeming to be in any significant abdominal discomfort. Patient is no longer utilizing stool softeners or MiraLAX. They are avoiding lactose and excess glucose intake. As for her long history of GERD, patient has been on Pepcid 40 mg once daily for several years with seemingly good control of patient's symptoms as there is no overt evidence that reflux is persisting. Typically, they are able to ""hear regurgitation"" when her reflux is poorly controlled, which has not been the case for several years. Therefore, they are interested in titrating off of Pepcid. Patient's parents deny signs of melena, hematochezia, vomiting, decreased appetite, or unintentional weight loss. Patient continues to have poorly controlled epilepsy and her last seizure was approximately 2 weeks ago, but they are working closely with patient's neurologist to optimize her medications.
05/22/24
Reena Cruz is a 36 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit for constipation. Pt's mother states that approximately 2-3 weeks ago pt had a few days of increased irritability and poor bowel movements, which prompted them to bring pt to the ER for further evaluation. At the ER, pt was found to have fecal impaction on CT, and she was disimpacted using 2 saline enemas. Since discharge, pt has restarted Linzess 290mcg and docusate sodium 5mL daily along with saline enemas once every 2 days, which has kept her bowel habits well controlled. Pt has now been having one sufficient bowel movement every 2 days, and is not displaying irritability. She has not also not displayed any significant abdominal bloating or flatulence as she had in the past with the regimen. Pt's parents have been trying Her GERD remains well controlled on Pepcid 20mg once daily. Pt's mom denies flatulence, bloating, melena, hematochezia, abdominal pain, vomiting, poor appetite, or unintentional weight loss.
8/8/2024
Able to speak with the Reyna's mother and father today, she is a 36-year-old noncommunicative patient that I have been following sometime with history of severe cerebral palsy and developmental delays. She is nonambulatory and has a BMI of 24, still having issues with constipation. She had been impacted on several occasions, we reviewed those previous, since her appointment in May she has had at least 1 other impaction. She has been given several different directions which I believe cause some confusion with how to utilize medical therapy to prevent this in the future. She has been given a prescription for lactulose 30 mL but told only to take it intermittently, she is not utilizing MiraLAX but will occasionally utilize docusate and Ex-Lax if symptoms develop. She is currently having 1-2 soft bowel movements a day without abdominal distention and her mother feels that she is quite comfortable at this time. She has been utilizing prune juice 8 ounces a day with successful management of her symptoms. We were able to review her overall situation, current medications and discussed strategies to prevent fecal impaction and constipation in the future.

Reena Cruz is a 37 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit for constipation and decreased appetite. Patient again presents with her parents who are assisting in providing a history given patient is noncommunicative as a result of her severe cerebral palsy and developmental delays. Patient's parents report a decrease in p.o. intake over the last few months. Patient will appear hungry, and started eating a meal, but then after a few bites will purposely spit food back up without overt vomiting. However, on occasion she can complete a full meal. Patient has also turned down fluids, and will spit up water. Patient's mother states she is unsure if patient is in any pain though she can become agitated on occasion. Patient has lost about 10 pounds in the last 3 months. She remains on Pepcid 20 mg once daily, and was previously on 40 mg a day. Patient was evaluated by the dentist yesterday without any concerning findings. They have presented to Northeast Methodist ER last week due to her agitation and discomfort where a CT A/P, laboratory studies, UA, and checks x-ray were all unremarkable. Her constipation is intermittent and well-controlled dependent on her water intake. She remains on Linzess 290mcg once daily, docusate sodium 50mg/day, and prune juice as well as enemas prn. Pt's parents d/c miralax as it felt like it had caused more abdominal bloating, and also d/c lactulose as it was ""too aggressive"". Pt is currently having 1 BM every 2-3 days with small volumes of stool. They deny fevers, vomiting, or aspiration PNA. Pt is currently undergoing changes in her antiepileptics with her neurologist and had a breakthrough seizure 1 week ago
12/06/24
Reena Cruz is a 37 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit for constipation and decreased appetite. Patient's parents state that patient began to experience severe abdominal discomfort including screaming and crying after use of Linzess and MiraLAX daily. Therefore, over the last 2 weeks they discontinued use of all prescription laxatives now only utilizing prune juice daily, increase water intake, exercise, and enemas every 2 to 3 days. On this regimen, patient is having 1 bowel movement every 2 to 3 days with soft stools of small to medium volume. She is no longer experiencing abdominal pain as she has decreased the screening and crying. Patient also continues to have significant flatus. Patient was unable to utilize pantoprazole as she was chewing the medication which is not recommended. That being said, patient is actually had improvement in her regurgitation and appetite. She is now refusing food less often and has been able to regain some weight. She does still occasionally spit food back out, but without overt vomiting. They continue to work with a neurologist and are titrating off of Lamictal. She has not had any breakthrough seizures since the last visit

Reena Cruz is a 37 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit for constipation and decreased appetite. Patient's mother states that they restarted Linzess 290 mcg once daily approximately 2 weeks ago as patient did not tolerate lactulose. She is now doing well on Linzess and having bowel movements every 3 days with solid bowel movements utilizing enemas as needed. Patient also continues to take prune juice daily, but is not currently on MiraLAX. Patient's parents denies melena or hematochezia, and feel as though she is not in as much discomfort. They do utilize Gas-X as needed if they know her meals may result in worsening abdominal distention. In regards to her appetite, this appears to be back to baseline as she is eating 2 meals a day and tolerating a relatively normal diet. They deny any significant regurgitation or vomiting, and her weight has been stable. Patient has not having any fevers or significant choking episodes. She remains on famotidine 40 mg once at night and is not currently utilizing pantoprazole.

Patient's parents state that they had brought patient to the ER for evaluation due to findings of significant unintentional weight loss down to 97 pounds. They completed laboratory testing that did have evidence of a UTI, but was otherwise unremarkable. Patient is able to tolerate p.o. intake, but occasionally will have forceful swallows, regurgitation, and liquids dribbling out her mouth, which could be indicative of difficulty swallowing though may also just be related to patient's refusal to eat. However, she also has periods of time where she is tolerating a completely normal diet and eating all meals without problem. Patient does remain on famotidine 40 mg a day as well. Her bowel habits are currently well-controlled utilizing increased water intake, exercise, and enemas as needed. Patient was very irritable on both Linzess, lactulose, and MiraLAX as she was exhibiting increased irritability, and thus they discontinued use. She is now having a soft and formed bowel movement every 2 to 4 days with the use of enemas. Patient has not had any recurrence of impactions since incorporating this regimen. They deny evidence of vomiting, melena, medic easier, or fevers. Patient did suffer a free seizure on 04/13 due to side effect of one of the antibiotics initially given for her UTI, but was previously stable and has not had a seizure since.

Assessment:
Reena Cruz is a pleasant 38-year-old female with a past medical history of severe cerebral palsy and intellectual delay who is onverbal and presents for a follow-up on constipation and GERD. Pt's bowel habits have remained relatively well-controlled with enemas prn, fiber supplementation, increase water intake, and exercise alone without recurrence of impactions. She also remains off of antacid therapy despite evidence of mild reflux esophagitis on recent EGD biopsies. That being said, her weight has increased without s/s of dysphagia or GERD as reported by her parents. Pt's parents remain hesitant and decline to initiate any medical therapy at this time as patient has been doing well without significant irritation. Therefore, it is reasonable to continue with pt's current course, but again cautioned her parents extensively to be vigilant for signs of fecal impactions given her history and also monitor her weight closely continuing with protein shakes daily. Patient's parents expressed understanding and agreed with plan.
Plan:
High fiber diet
Adhere to lifestyle and dietary modifications for GERD diet as we discussed. This includes avoiding fatty and greasy foods, fried foods, tomato based foods, caffeine, carbonated drinks, coffee and alcohol. Elevate the head of your bed 6 inches. Additionally, do not eat or drink anything including water within two hours of going to bed at night or 10pm, whichever comes first. Recommend low fat, low cholesterol diet and exercise.

Assessment:
Has had intermittent RUQ/epigastric abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting since early 2024, leading to diagnosis of gastroparesis April 2025 (GES 4-hour retention 43%.)
-Due to severity of symptoms, has lost significant weight since August 2024, leading to her last visit August 2025, where symptoms were largely preventing her from tolerating most p.o. intake.
-At that time was using Reglan 5 mg only sparingly, though it was acknowledged at her May 2025 visit that Reglan did help improve her symptoms.
Today, confirms that if she uses Reglan 5 mg prior to eating, she does not experience issues with abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.
-Still only using Reglan around 1-2x/day, when eating  ""meals.""
-With this, weight has stabilized, but CC is persistent decreased appetite.
Recommend:
-Increase Reglan 5 mg to scheduled, 3 times daily.
--Take 1 tablet in the morning, monitoring for any improvement in appetite. Also to allow her to eat even something small without fear of developing gastroparesis symptoms.
--Continue dose with afternoon meal, and again in the evening scheduled.
--Recommend using a fourth dose as needed for any further snacks during the day.
-Aware of potential side effects, including TD, with Reglan, aware to stop the medication and contact clinic for any concerning signs or symptoms.
--Long-term plan continues to be reducing dose to as needed in the future once acute flare has resolved.
------
Reviewing her blood work today,
-Follow up with PCP to address low TSH (FT4 WNL.)
-Persistent chronic anemia, likely related to anemia of chronic disease, possibly exacerbated by folate deficiency.
--Start OTC folate supplement.
--Continue with transplant/nephrology.
-Ferritin elevated 625. Patient confirms she has not been on iron supplementation, oral/IV, for 6+ months.
--March 2025- ferritin 497. Sept 2018, initial liver serology workup, ferritin 216.
-Refer to hematology for further evaluation and management, particularly given her recent low white blood cell count.
-HFE testing
Of note, previously seen in 2018 for elevated LFTs, workup with overall suspected NASH. Referred to Pinnacle.
-Renal transplant October 2021.
-Referred back April 2022 for persistently elevated LFTs, on tacrolimus given transplant status.
--FibroScan CAP 251, kPa 7.6. Referred to MSTH hepatology.
Recommend close follow-up in 2 months.
-Expect her acute gastroparesis symptoms to be well-managed on Reglan, leading to improved nutrition and weight. At that time, when patient is stabilized, can readdress her liver status, and confirm she reestablishes with hepatology, if not still following.
Time spent in counseling and/or coordination of care (including but not limited to reviewing prior records, arranging further services, communicating further with other care providers) was at least 65 minutes with more than 50% of this time spent in face-to-face or direct telecommunication with the patient.

Diagnosis:
Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)
GERD with esophagitis
Constipation
Delayed gastric emptying
Assessment:
1. MASLD - Patient has a history of MASLD with fibroscan and liver biopsy confirming macrovesicular steatosis with minimal fibrosis. Her labs have shown an elevated ALP with normal AST/ALT. We discussed the pathophysiology and natural history of fatty liver disease. We discussed the importance of weight loss and dietary changes to reduce fatty liver and even fibrosis. Repeat FibroScan study revealing improved fibrosis score along with normal CMP. Repeat Fibroscan 9/2023 was slightly improved. We discussed lifestyle modifications including low fat diet, particularly the Mediterranean diet, weight loss, alcohol cessation, black coffee 2-3 cups daily (although pt is getting worked up for autonomic dysfunction), and exercise as tolerated. Will reassess labs and calculate FIB4/NAFLD score to assess risk. Will repeat Fibroscan in 1 year since her MR Elastography in 11.2024 demonstrated mild hepatic steatosis without evidence of fibrosis.
2. GERD with esophagitis - The patient reports history of regurgitation previously placed on H2B at bedtime. She is currently taking Pepcid 40 mg p.o. at bedtime and sx are controlled at this time. Will continue.
3. Constipation: DDx. includes medication induced v. chronic idiopathic constipation v. IBS-C v. slow transit constipation v. pelvic floor dysfunction v. metabolic derangements v. lack on fluid/fiber intake etc. We discussed the pathophysiology and natural history of the various causes of constipation. Further diagnostic testing includes laboratory testing, imaging, and endoscopic evaluation. We discussed the various symptoms of constipation including infrequency, excessive straining, incomplete emptying, hard stools, bloating, use of digital evacuation etc. At this stage, will plan to optimize the patient's bowel regimen with MIraLAX 1-3x/day and Citrucel 1-2 tabs/day, titrated based on symptoms. Increase exercise as tolerated. I advised to maintain adequate hydration with at least 64 oz/day with exercise as tolerated. This usually occurs in accordance with her IVIG infusions. She takes Miralax and that relieves her constipation.
4. Delayed gastric emptying: NM GES: 7/2024 with delayed emptying at 1hr, but normal by 4hr. We discussed that this is not diagnostic of gastroparesis, but patient may have symptoms with these findings- difficult to clinically correlate but generally treated like gastroparesis. She reports a family history of GP and has dysautonomia with DM which can result in these findings.
Plan:
Recommend lifestyle modifications- low fat diet, avoid alcohol consumption, and exercise 30 minutes per day, with a goal of 5x/weekly.
Lose weight with diet/exercise as discussed. Attempt 10% body weight loss over 6 months.*
Avoid herbal remedies, supplements, or medications other than those recommended by healthcare provider

Diarrhea, Abd Pain
History of Present Illness:
Vanessa Pascual is a 41 year old female patient who is seen today for an initial visit to establish care since moving to TX from Florida this past summer.
She states that she has a hx of GERD and a hiatal hernia for which she underwent a fundoplication in Nov 2023. She had an EGD in May 2025 with Bravo and was told that everything was normal. She was advised to manage anxiety, so she was started on SSRI in June 2025 with significant relief to her GI sx. She also sees a therapist.
Patient states that she developed abdominal pain last August for which she was seen and evaluated by OBGYN and Urology then finally had a CT scan that showed uncomplicated diverticulitis for which she was treated with abx with relief to her sx. She underwent colonoscopy in May 2025 and was advised 7 year surveillance due to personal hx of colon polyps. Has had 3-4 colonoscopies in her lifetime and had her first one in her 20s due to hematochezia. She had been overall doing well until 2-3 weeks ago when she started to experience left sided and bilateral lower abdominal cramping. States sx are intermittent and occur randomly, not related to food intake. States sx are mild but overall annoying. Used to be on Dicyclomine per GI in Florida with relief. However, she experienced 3 episodes of diarrhea about 3 days ago. Stools have become more formed but still more loose than her baseline. Stools currently BSS 5-6 and her baseline is 4. Both daughters have been sick recently. cramping resolves with Tylenol but can last a couple of hours when she does not take Tylenol. She is focusing on oral hydration and taking metamucil five capsules per day. This regimen is keeping her bowel movements regular otherwise she tends to suffer from constipation, averaging one bowel movement every 2 days with straining.
Denies unintentional weight loss, nausea, vomiting or blood in stool. Has intermittent dysphagia ever since her fundoplication. Had celiac testing that was negative in the past.
Mom had breast cancer that metastasized to the colon. Denies family history of primary colon cancer, esophageal, gastric, or pancreatic cancer.

Vanessa Pascual is a 41F with PMHx of GERD and hiatal hernia s/p fundoplication, diverticulitis, and IBS who presents to establish care and also due to 2-3 weeks of left and bilateral lower abdominal cramping as well as acute onset of diarrhea 3 days ago, though the diarrhea has been improving on its own. EGD/colonoscopy May 2025 unremarkable. EGD results are per patient report. At this time, will proceed with stool PCR for the new onset diarrhea in the context of recently ill daughters however pt advised that if diarrhea continues to improve on its own and stool becomes formed then she can hold off on stool PCR since a lot of infectious causes are self limited. For cramping, will send Rx for hyoscyamine since she had success with antispasmodics in the past. Handout was given for high fiber diet with goal of 25 grams per day. Discussed importance of oral hydration and limiting red meat intake for hx of diverticulosis. Precautions for recurrence of diverticulitis discussed.
Plan:
GI stool pathogen panel by PCR (WISE Diagnostics only)
hyoscyamine sulfate 0.125 mg Administer 1 tablet under tongue every 6-8 hours as needed for abdominal pain/cramps
Follow up in 9 months
Recommend high fiber diet (25 grams daily). Handout was given for high fiber diet.
Due for surveillance colonoscopy in May 2032

Diagnoses:
Hepatic steatosis
History of cholecystectomy
Elevated LFTs
Nausea alone
Assessment:
Elevated LFTs: Differential diagnosis of the patient's abnormal liver function testing includes gallstones, NAFLD, NASH, viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, thyroid disease, hemochromatosis, Wilson's Disease, Alpha-1 Anti trypsin disease, Drug-Induced Liver Injury, or others. Suspect due to cholelithiasis and hepatic steatosis. Will request copy of most recent labs from general surgeon (post surgery) for review. If still elevated, will consider repeat HFP vs hepatic workup. Treat hepatic steatosis as below.
Hepatic steatosis: We discussed the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of fatty liver disease. Risk factors include elevated BMI, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes but also highlighting that it is a diagnosis of exclusion. We discussed the spectrum of fatty liver and potential progression to cirrhosis as well as the potential complications of cirrhosis, but provided reassurance that this change occurs over time. I recommended abstinence from alcohol, and to pursue diet, exercise, and weight loss with a goal to lose at least 7-10% of body weight to help reverse steatosis and early fibrotic changes.
Nausea: Broad DDx. overall, that from a GI standpoint would include, but is not limited to, GERD v. peptic ulcer disease v. obstructive etiology v. gastroparesis v. constipation v. IBS v. IBD v. cannabis hyperemesis syndrome v. cyclical vomiting syndrome, less likely malignancy or ischemic processes. Certainly, extra-gastrointestinal etiologies are a consideration as well, especially if basic GI workup is unrevealing. OTC Prilosec ineffective. Start pantoprazole 40 mg before dinner as below. Avoid NSAIDs. We discussed a GERD diet in detail, patient should avoid trigger foods, avoid late meals, and elevate the head of the bed. Can consider EGD for further evaluation if symptoms worsen/fail to improve.
Plan:
Recommend lifestyle modifications- low fat diet, avoid alcohol consumption, and exercise 30 minutes per day, with a goal of 5x/weekly.
Low fat, low cholesterol diet
Adhere to lifestyle and dietary modifications for GERD diet as we discussed. This includes avoiding fatty and greasy foods, fried foods, tomato based foods, caffeine, carbonated drinks, coffee and alcohol. Elevate the head of your bed 6 inches. Additionally, do not eat or drink anything including water within two hours of going to bed at night or 10pm, whichever comes first. Recommend low fat, low cholesterol diet and exercise.
Avoid NSAIDs (Motrin, Advil, ibuprofen, Aleve, Naproxen, etc.)
pantoprazole 40 mg Take 1 tablet by mouth once a day 30 min before dinner
Medication side effects, complications, risks, benefits, alternatives, follow-up and compliance discussed with the patient.
Call office with any questions or concerns.
Follow-up office visit in 6 weeks
My office will obtain records from referring physician Copy of recent HFP from general surgeon's office
Lose weight with diet/exercise as discussed. Attempt 10% body weight loss over 6 months.*"

diarrhea
History of Present Illness:
Connie Young is a 78-year-old woman with a PMH HLD, mood disorder, and PMR and long term prednisone who presents for diarrhea.
She reports the onset of copious watery diarrhea over the past month. She is having 3-4 BM daily and 2-3 at night. Strikes with signficant urgency and high volume. No overt GIB but she has had FOBT testing since the onset of her symptoms and three separate tests came back positive. She notes a weight loss of 7 pounds over this time period as well. She's not certain that any particular type of food triggers her symptoms. SHe has some abdominal pain but no bloating. No dysphagia or dyspepsia. SHe's had some relief with imodium 4mg in the morning. No benefit from lomotil.
This occurs in the context of a prednisone taper. SHe's been on prednisone nearly continuously for several decades for her PMR. Currently taking 2mg daily and notes that even taking 2mg a day makes a big difference for her joint pain. She has had issues with diarrhea previously when her prednisone was tapered.
Her last colonoscopy was in 2003 and was reportedly normal. She rports doing ColoGuard since that time with her last negative cologuard in 2022.
Describes some oropharyngeal dysphagia which she attributes to chronically having a dry mouth.

Assessment:
#Diarrhea
Significant watery diarrhea onset with prednisone wean. She has experienced similar symptoms when her prednisone was weaned in the past. No abdominal bain. Concern for an unmasked inflammatory diarrhea (eg microscopic colitis, IBD) vs a manifestation of adrenal insufficiency. Acute infectious diarrhea less likely given duration, but parasitosis and celiac dz plausible.
- Celiac panel, stool O&P
- AM serum cortisol
- Titrate imodium at 4mg up to four times a day. Counseled her to titrate this slowly
- Metmaucil pills (patient does not like powder or gummies) for stool consistency
- If symptoms persistent/severe despite these changes, can introduce budesonide pending colonoscopy
- Colonosocpy to assess for microscopic colitis and IBD; she should take prednisone 10mg daily for two days prior and the day of her procedure given the possibility of adrenal insufficency
#Positive FOBT
Colonsocopy as above
#Oropharyngeal dysphagia
Mild. Due to dry mouth per patient. Avoid anticholinergic and continue to use water to moisten mouth. Consider artificial saliva if this worsens. Could be amanifestation of sicca syndrome, but presence of this disease would not change treatment course.

constipation, heartburn, rectal bleeding
History of Present Illness:
Ms. Morrison is here for office visit.
Constipation that started July at the end of she completed GLP 1 agonist which was stopped due to lack of insurance coverage.  She used to have regular bowel movement before this.  For 2 months she has been having extreme constipation primarily around her periods, hard stools difficult to evacuate, sense of incomplete evacuation primarily from bloating, had a brief episode of rectal bleeding on wiping and she was so worried.  She has done MiraLax for a week and then seen in our office and given Linzess with which she would have loose stools and have good evacuation but abdominal bloating continues, primarily later in the day especially after eating.  The pain is lower abdominal contracting cramping can return a few minutes later, unsure if this is secondary to Linzess but associated with bloating makes her feel she is incompletely evacuating.
Heartburn after GLP 1 agonist and feels a in the throat which was worse but better now with pantoprazole 3 times a week, no dysphagia hematemesis.  heartburn Is better.  Whenever EGD.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abbreviated findings
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cumulative assessment and plan:
*Heartburn
Recommended to stop all PPI for at least 2 weeks and then EGD to assess for baseline esophagitis and valve and hiatal hernia.
Future recommendations based on findings and I think she may benefit from taking Prilosec over-the-counter every day.
*Constipation
*Lower abdominal pain
*Rectal bleeding
Possibly internal hemorrhoids but we will investigate.
Recommended MiraLax every single day brand only and discussed how to take it.
Therapeutic exercises.
Gluten free and dairy free trial.
Stop Linzess
despite softening her stools if she has abdominal cramping and discomfort then we will  use antispasmodics.
Also to consider testing if not better with gluten and dairy free.

# Constipation with abdominal pain and bloating - K59.00, R10.9, R14.0
- Possible causes discussed: Hormonal influence, post-Zepbound effect, slow transit constipation, IBS-C, dietary factors (dairy/gluten).
- Investigations planned: Trial of gluten-free and dairy-free diet.
-  Stop Linzess. Start Miralax, two tablespoons in a water bottle, sipped throughout the morning daily. Titrate dose based on stool consistency. Discussed proper technique for bowel movements (leaning back with knees apart). If cramping persists despite soft stools, will consider adding an antispasmodic.
- Future options: Antispasmodic medication.
# Hematochezia - K62.5
- Possible differential diagnosis and possible causes discussed: Hemorrhoids vs. other colonic pathology.
-  Plan for colonoscopy. The risks and benefits, preparation, and procedural details were discussed and any questions were answered.
# GERD-like symptoms (lump in throat) - K21.9
-
-  Plan for EGD. The risks and benefits, preparation, and procedural details were discussed and any questions were answered.
- Medical treatment planned: Stop PPI (Prilosec/Pylopac) for at least 2 wk, preferably 4 wk, prior to EGD. May use Gaviscon Extra Strength or Tums for symptom relief as needed.
Plan:
EGD/Colonoscopy with Anesthesia Provider/CRNA who is hereby directed and authorized to administer anesthesia - 43235/45378.. 2 Senna tablets the morning before colonoscopy procedure.

Therapeutic Exercises
Additional Notes:
After Visit Summary:
- Your main issues are constipation, bloating, abdominal pain, and some bleeding. We discussed that these symptoms are significantly influenced by your hormonal cycle, but we will focus on managing the GI aspects.
- We will proceed with a colonoscopy to check for the cause of bleeding, such as hemorrhoids, and to ensure the colon is healthy. At the same time, we will perform an upper endoscopy (EGD) to look at your esophagus and stomach for the cause of the lump-in-throat sensation.
- You must stop taking your acid reflux pill (Prilosec or similar) for at least two weeks before the procedures. You can use Tums or Gaviscon Extra Strength for heartburn if needed.
- We will stop the Linzess. Instead, you will start taking Miralax. Mix two tablespoons in a water bottle each morning and sip it throughout the day. This dose can be adjusted down if your stools become too loose. The goal is to keep your stools soft without causing diarrhea.
- I recommend trying a gluten-free and dairy-free diet to see if it helps with your bloating and pain.
- We also discussed a specific sitting posture for having a bowel movement.

History of Present Illness:
Stuart Ware is a 44 year old  male patient who is seen at the request of Nickolas Hadley for a consultation/initial visit. This is a patient here to see me for evaluation of hematochezia. The bleeding has been occurring for a prolonged period, estimated to be at least two years. The bleeding is described as bright red blood that turns the toilet water red, and is also admixed within the stool. The appearance can be both bright red and dark red, with some clots. The onset of symptoms is recalled to be shortly after a major surgery in 2020 for a brain aneurysm, which involved a trans-femoral approach through the groin. During that period, they were on multiple medications, including corticosteroids, which have since been discontinued for years.
The patient reports associated changes in bowel habits for a similar duration. There is an increased frequency of bowel movements, occurring multiple times per day with small volumes. Stool consistency varies from soft and loose to pebble-like, but is not described as frank diarrhea. Mucus is also present in the stool. They report a sensation of incomplete evacuation and straining, feeling as though there is a blockage. The stool form is sometimes described as thin or pencil-like. There are no upper GI symptoms such as heartburn, reflux, nausea, vomiting, or dysphagia. There is no reported abdominal pain.
The past medical history is significant for psoriasis, which predates the gastrointestinal symptoms, without associated arthritis. There is a history of a brain aneurysm which was treated surgically in 2020. There is no history of ulcers in the mouth, no rashes other than the known psoriasis, and no painful vision or eye inflammation. There are no known complications from prior procedures or anesthesia.
Social history is negative for smoking, intravenous drug use, or nasal drug use. Alcohol and marijuana use were not discussed. There is a negative family history for colon cancer or colon polyps. There is no family history of other gastrointestinal issues.
There has been some intentional weight loss since January of this year due to dietary changes, described as ""eating cleaner"" with fewer processed foods. This change was made for their daughter's health, which is not gastrointestinal in nature. There has been no unintentional weight loss.

Diagnoses:	Hematochezia
Iron deficiency anemia
Assessment:
Assessment:
1. Hematochezia and change in bowel habits: The primary concern is the chronic hematochezia, described as bright red blood per rectum, associated with mucus, increased stool frequency, and a change in stool caliber to being pencil-like at times. The differential diagnosis is broad. Given the bright red nature of the blood, this is most likely from a lower GI source. Common causes include internal hemorrhoids, which are often painless, and anal fissures, though fissures are typically painful. Given the change in bowel habits, sensation of blockage, and mucus, more significant pathology such as colonic polyps, diverticulosis, or a neoplasm must be ruled out. Additionally, given the history of psoriasis, an associated inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease is a consideration, as autoimmune conditions can cluster. Mucus in the stool is often a marker of inflammation. The current symptoms warrant a direct visualization of the colon.
Iron deficiency anemia:
Given ongoing clinical issues suspect  colon or distal small bowel source. Will start with colonoscopy
Plan:
- A colonoscopy is planned to investigate the etiology of the hematochezia and change in bowel habits. We will look for inflammation, ulceration, polyps, diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, and any other abnormalities. Biopsies will be taken of any abnormal-appearing tissue, and any polyps found will be removed.
- The risks and benefits, preparation, and procedural details were discussed and any questions were answered. Risks discussed include a less than 1% risk of perforation, bleeding, and infection. It was explained that the procedure would be performed with deep sedation using propofol, administered by an anesthesia provider. The need for a driver to and from the procedure was also explained.
- Follow-up will be scheduled after the procedure to discuss the findings and any further management.
Plan:	Colonoscopy with Anesthesia Provider/CRNA who is hereby directed and authorized to administer anesthesia - 45378
Additional Notes:	This patient has been evaluated and is a candidate for an Outpatient Surgery Center."

History of Present Illness:
Dorothy Cheramie is a 84 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit. Last visit 7/23/2025. She presents today with constipation and RLQ abdominal pain. Labs 7/2025 with H/H 11.5/34.6, CMP with 133.4, K 3.1, GFR 63, Glucose 129,  normal LFTs, Normal Thyroid levels - reviewed again with patient today. She was ordered CT but refused it due to feeling as if she was having too much going on (history of shingles to face in May, had issues with afib, had a fall with fracture, and has aldo has recent eye issues - she is currently following Dr Arceneaux, Dr Cenac, Dr Rais, Dr Gaudet). After her last visit here she started MiraLAX daily which has helped some and she is currently having a bowel movement every other day and can occasion have incomplete defecation and require straining and with this she can have mucous at times. She admits to history of chronic intermittent constipation (although at last visit she reports it had only been occurring x 6 months). She has previously been on Linzess, lactulose, dicyclomine and librax but does not recall the results of this. Her prior RLQ abdominal pain has also improved but could continue more mildly. She is unsure of triggers but also admits to having a fall around the time of onset of her RLQ abdominal pain. Denies dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, GERD symptoms or upper abdominal pain. She feels she has lost weight, however, she is up 7 pounds since last visit here. She remains on baby aspirin and eliquis. DM is overall under control. She does not have her gallbladder. EGD/Colonoscopy 2019. Last CT 2019. History of ventral hernia repair with Schwab in the past. Dad with colon cancer.

Procedure Follow Up
History of Present Illness:
This is a follow-up visit for a 56-year-old male to discuss the results of a recent colectomy. The procedure was performed due to a history of mild and well-controlled ulcerative colitis. He tolerated the procedure well, with no issues post-operatively, and continues to be asymptomatic. The colectomy involved removal of a polyp in the sigmoid colon. Random biopsies were also taken throughout the colon. He has a known history of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and undergoes surveillance for an increased risk of colon cancer. He reports no current gastrointestinal complaints. He is also being monitored for PSC with regular liver scans and blood work.
Prior Tests Reviewed:
- Colonoscopy with biopsy: A polyp in the sigmoid colon was removed. Biopsy results showed a hyperplastic polyp, which is benign. Random biopsies from other areas of the colon were negative for colitis.
- Labs from 07/09/2025: ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase were normal. CA 19-9 was slightly elevated at 41, which is consistent with prior results. Alpha-fetoprotein was 6.1. Hemoglobin was normal. Platelet count was 182.
- Abdominal Ultrasound with Dopplers from 07/09/2025: Performed by Dr. McFadden. No MRI has been performed this year. The last abdominal MRI was in December of the previous year.
- CT Chest: Performed by Dr. Dial for evaluation of a lung nodule seen on a chest x-ray, which was done for a cough. The nodule has reportedly been present since his teenage years.
8/18/2025 This is a telehealth appointment conducted from my office at 11920 Astoria Blvd Suite 440 Houston, TX 77089 using audio connection only. Appropriate informed consent was obtained. This is a follow up visit. He followed up with transplant team in 07/2025 and underwent labs and liver ultrasound at that time. He was told that his PSC is relatively stable and to follow up in 6 months. He remains on mesalamine for his UC with good control of his GI symptoms. He denies any ongoing abdominal pain, change in bowel movement, rectal bleeding. He is due for colonoscopy for colorectal cancer surveillance, which I will order today. He is not due for EGD, given that he had EGD in 06/2024 and overall feels stable on pantoprazole 40mg QD. Discussed risks and benefits of procedure with patient.
4/16/2025 He is here for routine follow-up after almost a year. In the meantime he has been following with Methodist transplant hepatology regarding PSC. We reviewed his most recent MRI which was done in December with stable fibrotic changes and no focal suspicious liver lesion. No dominant stricture or extrahepatic biliary dilation noted. Labs are significant for slightly elevated CA 19-9 at 55. Patient denies any recent UC symptoms. Specifically no diarrhea, rectal bleeding, or abdominal pain. He was very recently diagnosed with diabetes and A1c of 6.7. He was started on metformin after insurance denied Ozempic and reports that stools are little softer on metformin. Encouraged diet and exercise implementation and could consider stool testing if he develops diarrhea in the future. Otherwise he is due for surveillance colonoscopy in September.
5/14/2024 He is here for routine follow-up along with his wife. Recently reports worsening GERD symptoms and new onset globus sensation. He saw an ENT doctor who ordered barium video esophagram. Results reviewed with patient including moderate gastroesophageal reflux and no stricture. He has been taking Alka-Seltzer with partial symptomatic response. He is also on Pepcid which he takes in combination with Allegra for his allergies. No prior PPI use. He has gained about 20 pounds since last year due to dietary indiscretion and decreased physical activity. He is going to physical therapy due to left hip pain and partial labrum tear. Discussed recommendations for weight loss and dietary modifications. Recommend repeat EGD given worsening symptoms. We did discuss the possibility of starting daily PPI however he would like to wait until after the procedure to start a new medication if necessary. UC symptoms are well-controlled. Continue mesalamine 2.4 g a day. He also had a recent MRI with his hepatologist in the Medical Center which we will request for records.
1/29/24 This is a telehealth appointment conducted from my office at 11920 Astoria Blvd Suite 440 Houston, TX 77089 using audio connection only. Appropriate informed consent was obtained. This is a follow up visit. Patient reports feeling well today. He reports few episodes of intermittent diarrhea with associated rectal bleeding, which he attributes to poor diet. He also reports intermittent cramping in R side of abdomen. Denies fever, nausea, vomiting. Tolerating regular diet. He saw Dr. McFadden in 12/23 for his PSC and has surveillance MRI scheduled for 03/24. He plans to consult with new PCP through the VA in 04/24. He remains on ursodiol 250mg BID and mesalamine 1.2g 2 tablets daily. He had labs with Dr. McFadden in 12/23, which he reports are stable. We will request those today. Follow up in 3 months.
10/6/2023 Patient is here for procedure follow up. Colonoscopy in 09/23 with hyperplastic polyp, small internal hemorrhoids, biopsies negative for colitis and dysplasia. Recall colonoscopy in 2 years. Today, patient reports feeling well. He denies abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, visible GI bleeding. He has 1-2 formed BMs daily. He remains on mesalamine 1 tablet daily. He is working on scheduling follow up with Dr. McFadden over next couple of months. He is due for surveillance labs, which I will order today. Follow up in 3 months.
8/30/2023 Patient is here for follow up. Today, patient reports feeling well. Reports intermittent dull RUQ pain after eating certain foods. Denies nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, black or bloody stools. He remains on mesalamine BID. He followed up with Dr. McFadden in 06/23 and was told that his PSC was stable. He had labs and MRI at that time. He is due for a surveillance colonoscopy, which will be ordered today. Discussed risks and benefits of procedures with patient.
03/08/2023  Patient is here for routine follow up. He followed up with Dr. McFadden, hepatologist @ Methodist-TMC 1 month ago, who ordered repeat blood work and imaging. Patient was told that PSC is stable. No acute complaints today. Denies changes in BMs Had one episode of rectal bleeding with painful BM. Started metamucil last month, which has helped BMs become more regular. No additional rectal bleeding or painful BMs since starting metamucil. Denies abdominal pain, N/V, change in appetite. Patient due for next colonoscopy in 09/23.
12/08/2022 Since last visit he was sent to liver transplant department at UT who he was previously following up given concerns for progression of her primary sclerosing cholangitis on MRI done in July 2022 with either fibrosis versus cholangiocarcinoma. He was seen by the transplant hepatologist however due to some insurance issues he was referred to Methodist transplant center. Patient apparently had labs as well as an ultrasound with Dopplers done and has a follow-up back with them in few weeks. He denies any new concerns. Denies any abdominal pain nausea vomiting jaundice or diarrhea. He remains on ursodiol as well as LDL the for ulcerative colitis in remission.
09/01/2022 He is here for follow-up. No new complaints. He underwent upper endoscopy as part of preoperative evaluation for possible bariatric gastric sleeve procedure. Upper endoscopy was within normal limits without any evidence of varices or portal gastropathy. Gastric biopsies negative for H. pylori. He had a routine labs done that were within normal limits particularly normal liver function panel as well as normal CA 19–9. He had an MRI done as part of annual surveillance given primary sclerosing cholangitis that does show multifocal intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation of the right hepatic lobe consistent with the known diagnosis of PSC. Multifocal areas of T1 hypointense signal, T2 hyperintense signal enhancement on delayed postcontrast images noted, radiologist noted that even though the pattern is similar to prior MRI in April 2021 cholangiocarcinoma was favored given abnormal signal on T2 sequence. Given this finding I have recommended that he follow-up back with the transplant clinic for multidisciplinary review of his scans and further management. I recommended that he hold off on bariatric surgery for the time being until cleared by transplant clinic. As per ulcerative colitis symptoms are under control with the Lialda. He will be coming up due for a surveillance colonoscopy next year.
07/28/2022 Patient is here to discuss the possibility of bariatric surgery. Consideration for weight loss surgery was initially discussed with him by his cardiologist given BMI of 40 and associated risk for cardiovascular disease. He does have a history of ulcerative colitis which is well controlled with Lialda as well as PSC. He is planning to do a repeat MRI for PSA surveillance tomorrow. No recent EGD and I have recommended this to help rule out any varices in the esophagus or stomach. He has a history of reflux however this is quite mild recently and controlled with H2 blocker only as needed. Per patient, he has been seeing Dr. Trahan and gastric sleeve has been preferentially recommended to him over gastric bypass so as to preserve endoscopic access to bile ducts if needed. No absolute contraindication for the surgery in his case. We will review repeat imaging and EGD findings prior to giving final recommendations to patient/surgeon.
04/12/2022 This is a telehealth visit being conducted at the request of patient from my office (11920 Astoria Blvd, St 410, Houston 77089) using bidirectional synchronous video communication tool. Appropriate informed consent was obtained. This is a routine follow-up after 6 months. Patient reports doing well overall with no new GI complaints. He has been gaining weight recently due to dietary indiscretion. He is planning to start a diet and exercise regimen soon. Has inquired about bariatric surgery however I strongly recommended lifestyle modifications initially given his comorbidities. UC symptoms are well controlled on Lialda 2 tablets daily. He reports he had a CT scan a few months ago when he went to Methodist Hospital with infection of unclear origin- I will try to get these records. He is due for labs including tumor markers–CA 19-9 and MRI. Up-to-date on screening colonoscopy. Next one will be due in 2023. I provided refills for his GI medications. He is also requesting a short-term refill of Flomax which he takes for BPH since he has been unable to obtain this from PCP.
9/29/2021 This is a procedure follow up after recent colonoscopy. Discussed procedure findings in detail including small 5 mm rectal polyp which was hyperplastic on pathology. Pathology showed colonic eosinophilia more on the right side without dysplasia. Ulcerative colitis symptoms have been well controlled with Lialda 2 tablets daily and I recommend that he continue current dosage. He is having about 2 BM per day without bleeding or abdominal pain.  He will follow-up in 6 months or sooner if he has any worsening symptoms. From a PSC standpoint, patient was given an order for CA 19-9 labs at his last visit however has misplaced this and I posted to the portal again for him. We will call patient with these results once available. Total time spent was 20 minutes.
9/1/21 Is here for routine follow-up. He had recent labs done with his PCP which were all within normal limits. He will need a CA 19–9. Liver function tests were normal. Last MRI was in April 2021 that showed stable irregularity of the intrahepatic biliary tree, normal caliber common bile duct, chronic periductal fibrosis and inflammation with partial right hepatic atrophy. She has gained 20 pounds due to dietary indiscretion, states that has been stress eating and has recently quit his job. Recommended diet, lifestyle changes. He is due for screening colonoscopy given history of ulcerative colitis. Symptoms are stable on Lialda.
04/05/2021 This is a telehealth visit being conducted at the request of patient from my office using bidirectional synchronous video communication tool. Appropriate informed consent was obtained. This is a follow-up visit. Most recent liver function tests from a month ago were within normal limits. He underwent a HIDA scan for intermittent right upper quadrant pain which was within normal limits with ejection fraction of 50% after a fatty meal. As such cholecystectomy was not recommended unless symptoms become severe. He will need a surveillance MRI with regards to PSC. He remains on Lialda for ulcerative colitis which appears to be in remission.
10/01/2020 This is a telehealth visit being conducted at the request of patient from my office using bidirectional synchronous video communication tool. Appropriate informed consent was obtained. This is a follow-up visit. We discussed colonoscopy results which were overall normal without any evidence of active colitis. 2 polyps were noted which were removed and were noted to be hyperplastic. He denies any diarrhea or rectal bleeding. We have agreed to continue Lialda, folic acid supplementation as well as probiotic daily. As per PSC, his most recent liver enzymes have been stable. We discussed the ERCP findings from June 2020. Common biliary stent was removed. He does have mild intermittent right upper quadrant pain more so when he eats a fatty meal. Cholangiogram did show good filling of gallbladder without any filling defects. I did discuss possibility of a calculus cholecystitis or biliary dyskinesia. I recommend a nuclear medicine HIDA scan and if positive may consider referral to transplant hepatic surgeon for elective cholecystectomy. Given COVID pandemic and since symptoms are mild if agreed to hold off on the referral list here. We will follow-up back with him in 4 months with repeat labs. Given that he had an ERCP in June he decided to postpone the MRI imaging to next year.
07/02/2020 This is a telehealth visit being conducted at the request of patient from my office using bidirectional synchronous video communication tool. Appropriate informed consent was obtained. This is a follow-up visit. He underwent repeat ERCP a month ago with removal of stent. Common bile duct measures 6 to 7 mm. Intrahepatics were narrow particularly on the right side which did not feel much. Balloon sweep with small amount of sludge no stones. Gallbladder did not fill. Patient notes improvement in right upper quadrant pain. No fever. His liver function tests were done recently which were within normal limits. Therefore I have asked him to hold off and not go back on ursodiol for the time being. He remains on Lialda 2.4 g with good control of ulcerative colitis symptoms. He is due for colonoscopy which will be scheduled later once the current COVID surge numbers have improved. His CA 19–9 level has come down a little bit but remains persistently elevated over the last 3 to 4years. No mass lesions noted on recent imaging. We will repeat another MRI with liver mass protocol prior to the end of the year and moving forward I recommended that we will be doing this every 6 months to rule out cholangiocarcinoma. He did reestablish with liver transplant department and I have recommended to keep in touch with them at least every 6 months if possible. In addition he has gained about 30 pounds primarily due to COVID and not exercising. I have strongly recommended diet exercise regimen to decrease risk of fatty liver disease.
04/20/2020 This is a telehealth visit being conducted at the request of patient from my office (11920 Astoria Blvd, St 410, Houston 77089) using bidirectional synchronous video communication tool. Appropriate informed consent was obtained. This is a follow-up after recent procedure. Patient underwent elective ERCP given history of primary sclerosing cholangitis, right upper quadrant pain and slight elevated tumor markers. He was noted to have diffuse multifocal strictures throughout the extrinsic common bile duct right intrahepatic duct did not feel much which corresponds to draw prominent right liver lobe on MRI, left intrahepatics filled but were very probably, brushings were taken and showed reactive ductal epithelial cells but no malignant cells. A 10 French 9 cm plastic stent was left in place. Cholangioscopy was not done due to very narrow size of the common bile duct. Patient did have mild fever after the procedure and a follow-up CT was done after patient was admitted and did not show any hepatic abscess. He completed treatment with antibiotics. We have discussed long-term treatment options for primary sclerosing cholangitis, discussed removal of the stent with the possibility of worsening liver function tests. I recommended that he reconnect with the liver transplant center. He will continue on the ursodiol for the time being. We will bring him back in another 2 months to consider removal of the stent. IgG subclass 4 was sent and was not elevated. He notes improvement in right upper quadrant pain and no fever or chills at this time. Risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed.
01/29/2020 He is here to follow-up after Recent work-up. Labs show resolution in liver function tests, CA 19–9 remains elevated at 44. GFR is 44. He had a surveillance MRI that showed a normal gallbladder but the multifocal intrahepatic bile duct narrowing with intrahepatic biliary dilation with the dominant right lobe compatible with primary sclerosing cholangitis. A focal stricture of the common hepatic duct was noted similar to previous MRI. Also noted was a questionable intraluminal filling defect in the common bile duct which was nonocclusive could be a stone sludge or mass lesion. Given these findings I have recommended that we proceed with ERCP with the possible cholangioscopy, biopsies brushings and possible stent placement. He has atypical chest discomfort and neck pain and therefore I recommended that he see a cardiologist first and get a clearance to proceed. Is also having some numbness in the left cheek for few weeks and plans to see a neurologist.
12/05/2019 Is here to follow-up after 6 months. Continues to have intermittent right upper quadrant pain. He had recent labs done in November 2019 which were pertinent for elevated ALT of 214. He was sick with upper respiratory tract infection was on antibiotics and steroids during that time. He also drinks about ounce and a half of hard liquor every day. I recommended to abstain from all alcohol use. He will repeat liver function tests and add CA 19–9 which is always been slightly elevated in his case. Is also due for MRCP given primary sclerosing cholangitis. He will be due for colonoscopy next year. Labs from his PCP included ESr and CRP which were normal.
5/16/2019 Since last visit he had consultation with UT hepatology dept; recommended current managment; Urso only if LFTs go up; recent labs show normal LFTs. MRCP with PSC changes; no mass. LDL sligly high; recommended diet/exercise.
1/25/2019 He is here for followup of ulcerative colitis as well as primary sclerosing cholangitis. MRI done Novoste of 2018 at Clear Lake regional showed changes of primary sclerosing cholangitis. Multifocal narrowing of the biliary tree and common hepatic duct was noted. CA 19-9 was 34 which has been the same for the last 6 years. Show normal liver function tests. However he is starting to notice right upper quadrant pain 3/10 dull achy occasional burning sensation without any fever or chills. We have discussed long-term treatment options With regards to PSC. We have discussed continue monitoring with labs versus ERCP with brushings of the stricture as well as stenting. Long term options with any worsening of his liver function including liver transplant was discussed and I did encourage him to get a second opinion from a liver transplant center. If he does start having any fever or chills are jaundice then advised him to call us back at which time an ERCP will be scheduled.
8/6/2018 He is here to discuss workup for ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. He had a colonoscopy in June shows that his colitis is in remission. Biopsies did not show any evidence of active inflammation. Hyperplastic polyps were removed. He brought in labs from his PCP showed that his lipid panel is abnormal and his liver functions are completely normal. With regards to his PSC he had surveillance MRCP that showed focal narrowing of common hepatic duct approximately 15 mm above the cystic duct insertion. Common duct below this was normal at 6 mm. Right and left intrahepatic ducts show multifocal narrowing with irregular dilation notably in the right lobe of liver consistent with PSC. He does have occasional right upper quadrant discomfort but denies any fever or chills. No history of jaundice.
3/6/2018 He has not been seen in office in over a year and half. He has been traveling quite a bit and has been outside the country for the last 6 months. He had labs done recently with the primary care physician in December 2017 that showed liver tests were normal. More importantly his bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase have remained normal despite stopping ursodiol. I did discuss recent literature that shows that we do not need to restart or so unless there is abnormalities in alkaline phosphatase or he has clinical symptoms including pruritus which she does not have. His cholesterol panel remains abnormal with high LDL, I stressed importance of diet and exercise to him.No reports occasional rectal bleeding ongoing for the last 2 weeks. Mostly it is red blood when he wipes with toilet paper. Last hemoglobin in December was normal. He denies any lightheadedness or dizziness. Denies taking any blood thinners or NSAID S. His last colonoscopy was over 2 years and he is due for one now; given history of ulcerative colitis.

History of Present Illness:
Bala Chavali is a 74 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit to discuss chest discomfort. At the last consultation, there was a concern that this discomfort was related to reflux. A medication adjustment was made, adding famotidine at night to the existing morning dose of omeprazole. Bala reports this regimen worked well and the chest discomfort resolved. Two weeks ago, she finished the omeprazole prescription and decided to discontinue it to see if symptoms would recur. So far, the symptoms have not returned, and she is doing well. Bala continues to take famotidine 40 mg at night.
Bala notes a significant change in dietary tolerance, stating that even mildly spicy food now causes symptoms, which manifest immediately as a throat sensation. This has been an ongoing issue for many years. They expressed concern about whether this dietary restriction will be permanent. It was explained that it is common for the digestive system to become less tolerant of certain foods over time and this may be a permanent change for them. Bala also inquired about the long-term need for medication. It was discussed that while they may be able to manage without omeprazole for a period, it is possible that symptoms may flare up in the future, requiring further treatment. A potential future strategy discussed was increasing famotidine to twice daily if a flare-up occurs, before reintroducing omeprazole. For now, since symptoms are controlled on famotidine 40 mg nightly, the plan is to continue this and hold off on the omeprazole.
Bala also reports ongoing issues with constipation. This is managed with a high-fiber diet, including taking Benefiber two to three times daily and eating an orange or clementine at night. These measures are effective. She reports that Miralax was not helpful and is no longer being used.
Bala is planning a trip to India in December for two and a half weeks. She is concerned about a potential flare-up of reflux symptoms, as a similar trip last year triggered severe gas pains that resulted in a hospital visit. To prevent a recurrence, a new prescription for omeprazole will be provided to have on hand for the trip.

GERD (e)
Chronic constipation
Assessment:
1. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) - K21.9
- Assessment: Symptoms are currently well-controlled on famotidine monotherapy after discontinuing omeprazole. Experiences significant dietary-triggered symptoms with spicy foods.
- Treatment planned: Continue famotidine 40 mg at bedtime. A prescription for a 90-day supply with refills for one year will be sent to the pharmacy. A new 90-day supply of omeprazole will also be prescribed to have on hand for a planned international trip in December and for any potential future flare-ups. Bala was advised on the potential strategy of increasing famotidine to twice daily for a flare-up before restarting omeprazole.
- Investigations planned: None at this time.
2. Chronic constipation - K59.00
- Assessment: Symptoms are managed effectively with dietary modifications.
- Treatment planned: Continue current regimen of high-fiber diet, including Benefiber supplement 2-3 times daily and fruit intake. No pharmacologic intervention is needed at this time as Miralax was ineffective and current measures are successful.

Follow Up/ Diarrhea
History of Present Illness:
This is a follow-up visit for Joyce, whom I last saw in March 2025 for severe constipation. At that time, her symptoms were thought to be related to sigmoid colon narrowing secondary to diverticulosis. She continues to experience constipation. She has been prescribed stool softeners and lactulose, which she is using. She titrates the lactulose dose based on her symptoms, currently taking one ounce (30 ml) in the morning and one ounce at night. She reports that some days she is in the bathroom for a significant portion of the morning, while on other days, like today, she has not had a bowel movement, highlighting the unpredictable nature of her symptoms. She notes that a few days ago, she went two days without a bowel movement and then had significant difficulty initiating one.
There is a significant history of an admission in January of this year for what was effectively an obstruction. She presented to the emergency room after passing out on the toilet, secondary to nausea and other symptoms. Imaging at that time confirmed her colon was completely full of stool. She was admitted to the hospital for three days and required a rectal tube for decompression and disimpaction. This experience has made her consider more definitive treatment options. Her anatomy, specifically severe narrowing in the sigmoid colon from diverticulosis, is the underlying cause of her chronic and unpredictable bowel habits.
Prior Tests Reviewed:
- Colonoscopy from 05/2022 revealed severe narrowing in the sigmoid colon secondary to diverticular disease.
3/4/2025 Joyce is an 83-year-old female here for follow-up after being admitted to MHPL hospital for hypovolemic shock. She was noted to have extensive stool on CT and diverticulosis with luminal narrowing in the left colon, likely explaining severe constipation. She reports that her bowel movements have been inconsistent, with frequent bowel movements for a couple of days followed by a day without any bowel movement. She became allergic to Senna and Docusate, which she was taking for constipation, with hives on her toe within 30 minutes of taking the medication. This was the first time she was taking these medications. She has lost 12 pounds since the hospitalization but denies loss of appetite. She typically has a smoothie for breakfast and peanut butter.
Prior Tests Reviewed:
- CT scan showed extensive stool and diverticulosis with luminal narrowing in the left colon
2/7/2025 She is here for hospital follow-up after recent admission for abdominal pain, vomiting, and syncopal event at home. She was admitted to Memorial Hermann Pearland for hypovolemic shock and gastroenterology was consulted for possible partial bowel obstruction versus ileus. From a GI standpoint she gradually improved and was discharged home on a soft diet. She did not require NG tube compression. CT findings included dilated stomach, small bowel, and colonic loops with thickening of the gastric antrum and a severe ileus/enteritis and early changes of shock bowel. She also has diverticulosis without diverticulitis. She required vasopressor support temporarily. Denies rectal bleeding or hematemesis. Blood pressure has been low normal since discharge per patient. She has a f/u with her cardiologist next week. Review of CT during office visit today shows extensive stool throughout colon and prior colonoscopy showed diverticulosis with luminal narrowing in the left colon. She is feeling okay other than mild bloating after meals.  Discussed with patient that her symptoms may be related to severe constipation and suggested a more regular bowel regimen. Consider repeat EGD/colonoscopy if symptoms worsen.
5/31/2022 This is a follow-up after recent EGD and colonoscopy. Upper endoscopy. Mild gastritis negative for H. pylori. She remains on omeprazole 40 mg once a day. She has remote history of gastric ulcers but given relatively negative upper endoscopy recommend to cut down the omeprazole to 20 mg. Colonoscopy without any evidence of polyps but does have sigmoid diverticulosis with luminal narrowing but able to pass a pediatric scope across all the way to the cecum. Grade 2 internal hemorrhoids noted. High-fiber diet and supplementation was recommended. If she does have recurrent attacks of diverticulitis then I would suggest a colorectal surgery evaluation. She is not interested in surgical referral at this time.
04/26/2022 This is a 80-year-old female with past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, congestive heart failure, history of ischemic colitis about 15 years ago recently was admitted to Memorial Hermann Pearland hospital 2 weeks ago with complaints of rectal bleeding as well as abdominal cramps that started 1 day prior to presentation. In the ER she was noted to have leukocytosis with white blood cell count of 19.1 lactic acidosis of 2.7, hemoglobin 11.3. CT scan showed mild to moderate diffuse left and proximal to mid sigmoid colitis and severe sigmoid and mild right colonic diverticulosis. Her last colonoscopy was in July 2015 with findings of diverticulosis in the sigmoid with luminal narrowing. She also has reflux disease for which she has been taking PPI on a daily basis. She was discharged home on antibiotics and apparently notes improvement in symptoms. We did discuss differential diagnosis of ischemic colitis versus diverticulitis, less likely to be infectious colitis. Stool for C. difficile was ordered but it was not sent as she is not able to produce a liquid stool. I did recommend that if she does have liquid stools then proceed with the C. difficile testing and schedule an EGD and colonoscopy in 4 weeks time. Risks and benefits of procedure were discussed in detail.

Diagnosis:
Constipation
Diverticulosis of sigmoid colon (c) - narrowing
Assessment:
1. Severe constipation secondary to sigmoid colon stricture - K59.09, K57.30
- Likely diagnosis: Sigmoid stricture due to diverticular disease.
- Investigations planned: Will obtain an updated CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to reassess the anatomy and degree of narrowing in the sigmoid colon.
- Treatment planned: Continue lactulose, titrating the dose as needed for symptoms. She is currently taking 1 ounce twice daily and can increase this dose if needed. A refill for lactulose will be sent. We discussed that the only definitive treatment for her condition is surgical resection.
- Relevant referrals: A referral will be placed for a consultation with a colorectal surgeon to discuss the risks, benefits, and alternatives to a partial colectomy, specifically a sigmoid colectomy. This can likely be performed laparoscopically on an elective basis, which would avoid the need for an ostomy bag. The urgency for surgery was discussed in the context of preventing another obstructive episode, which if it occurs emergently, may necessitate an ostomy.

nausea
History of Present Illness:
Mark Booth is a 59 year old male who is seen today for a follow-up visit. The patient presents for a transfer of care from a previous gastroenterologist and for management of persistent, debilitating nausea with episodic vomiting. The reflux symptoms are reported to be fairly well controlled with the current medication regimen. The nausea is the primary debilitating symptom, which has been ongoing. The patient has tried multiple medications for nausea, including promethazine, ondansetron, and previously domperidone, with limited effectiveness. The symptoms significantly impact daily life. There is some upper abdominal discomfort associated with nausea and vomiting, but no current lower abdominal pain.
The patient denies hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, constipation, fecal urgency, unexplained weight loss, fever, and chills. There is no report of dysphagia or odynophagia.
Previous laboratory work showed a normal complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel, with the exception of a mild elevation in creatinine to 1.40. Celiac disease testing was negative. Stool studies from 05/06/2023 were positive for Yersinia enterocolitica but were otherwise negative. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis was ordered on 05/10/2023, but the results are not available. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed on 08/08/2023, which revealed esophagitis with esophageal ulceration in the lower third of the esophagus, non-atrophic gastritis, and non-eroded duodenitis. Pathology findings showed reactive gastropathy of the gastric antrum without evidence of Helicobacter pylori, and duodenal biopsies showed no significant pathology.
The past medical history is significant for gastroesophageal reflux disease, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a history of achalasia post Heller mytomy.

1. Recurrent Nausea and Vomiting, R11.2
- Assessment: recurrent nausea and vomiting
- Investigations planned for Issue 1: Given the recurrent nausea that has not been responsive to current therapy and the history of achalasia, further evaluation is warranted.
- Relevant referrals for Issue 1: A referral will be made to a tertiary care center at Baylor College of Medicine, specifically to the motility group with Dr. Kal Patel for further evaluation and management.
- List medications prescribed or discussed, with instructions: May continue to use ondansetron and promethazine as needed for nausea as previously prescribed. Domperidone was also used previously for nausea and vomiting.
2. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease, K21.9
- Assessment: gastroesophageal reflux disease
- Treatment planned for Issue 2: Continue current therapy.
- List medications prescribed or discussed, with instructions: Continue pantoprazole as prescribed.
3. Colonic diverticulosis, K57.90
- Assessment: colonic diverticulosis
- Treatment planned for Issue 3: Continue high fiber diet as long as it does not worsen nausea and vomiting and is well tolerated.
The patient is presenting for a transfer of care due to persistent and debilitating nausea with some vomiting. The history is complex, including achalasia post-cardiomyotomy, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and a prior Yersinia enterocolitica infection. The esophagogastroduodenoscopy from August 2023 showed esophagitis with ulceration. Given the refractory nature of the nausea, a referral to a tertiary motility specialist, Dr. Kal Patel at Baylor College of Medicine, is appropriate for further diagnostic workup and management. The patient will continue the current regimen of pantoprazole for reflux and may use ondansetron and promethazine as needed for nausea. A high fiber diet is recommended for diverticulosis, provided it is tolerated.
This note was created in part by using voice recognition software and was reviewed by the medical provider to ensure accuracy.
The visit involved a comprehensive history and extensive medical decision-making. The patient presents with multiple chronic, complex problems, and there was a detailed review and summary of extensive outside records. The risk of complications and morbidity from the presenting problems is high given the debilitating nature of the symptoms and the history of achalasia. A referral to another specialist was arranged. Based on these factors, the level of service is consistent with a 99204 billing code.

Gradual titration of fiber supplementation discussed (Benefiber, psyllium (Metamucil) or Citrucel - 1-2 heaped tablespoons daily with fluids.
Because of your history of adenomatous colon polyps or colon cancer your children and siblings should all have screening colonoscopies by age 40 and then at least every 5 years after that. If you were younger than 50 at the time of your first diagnosis of polyps or cancer, then your first degree relatives should start screening 10 years younger than that age. They are all at much higher risk of colon cancer and polyps than the average population."

Alcoholic cirrhosis, Ascites
History of Present Illness:
Luis Torres is a 66 year old male who is seen today for a follow-up visit. A 66-year-old male presents to the clinic for follow-up and to establish care for alcoholic cirrhosis. The patient is accompanied by his daughters. He was reportedly diagnosed with alcoholic cirrhosis in March 2025 at Methodist Baytown. He reports cessation of alcohol consumption since December 2024. Since the diagnosis, he has experienced recurrent admissions to the emergency room for fluid buildup in the abdomen, described as ascites, as well as for anxiety. During these hospitalizations for therapeutic paracentesis, approximately five liters of ascitic fluid were removed each time. The last paracentesis was performed about one and a half months ago, during which four to five liters of fluid were drained. He reports that he is now re-accumulating fluid. The symptoms of fluid retention, including abdominal distension and swelling, have a significant impact on his daily life, causing discomfort and requiring frequent medical interventions. He also reports feeling malnourished. He is currently prescribed lactulose three times daily for hepatic encephalopathy, which has been titrated by his family to manage bowel movements, aiming for a balance as he also experiences constipation. His daughters report he has approximately four to ten bowel movements per day. Due to constipation, MiraLAX has also been added to his regimen. He has a history of two episodes of hepatic encephalopathy. His current diuretic regimen includes furosemide 40 milligrams daily. Spironolactone was discontinued two weeks ago during a hospitalization on the advice of a cardiologist due to a heart condition. The plan was to follow up with his outpatient cardiologist before restarting spironolactone, but this appointment has not yet occurred. The patient's daughters also inquired about his eligibility for a liver transplant. The patient denies hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, odynophagia, fecal urgency, unexplained weight loss, fever, and chills. An upper endoscopy performed one month ago for variceal screening was normal. A colonoscopy performed seven months ago was also normal. Based on recent laboratory results from 08/30/2025, with a creatinine of 1.39, his Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score was calculated to be 25.
The past medical history is significant for asthma, alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites, diabetes mellitus, pancreatitis, and benign prostatic hyperplasia.
PAST SUMMARY: 06/10/2025
Luis Torres is a 65 year old male patient who is seen today for an initial visit. Pt is here with chirosis in liver. Patient was in hospital 6 months ago was diagnosed with Cirrhosis in the liver. Pt states they took out liquid insuerted tubes to his lower abdomen about 3-4 liters. Was told to come back every 2 months then every month then every 15 days to remove liquid. Pt was told by his primary care provider to stop drinking when he was told about Cirrhosis, pt states he stopped drinking about 3 years ago and his last drink was about 2 years ago. Pt said he keep being in hospital  every 2 weeks. Pt has been losing weight moths 10 lbs, feels nausea and his abd is unconfutable sometimes because of excess liquid.

Assessment:
I have discussed with patient in detail the current diagnosis and differential diagnosis.
1. Decompensated Alcoholic Cirrhosis, K70.31
- Assessment, likely diagnosis for Issue 1: Decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites
- Investigations planned for Issue 1: A complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and prothrombin time/international normalized ratio will be repeated to calculate a current Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score. An abdominal ultrasound will be ordered to screen for hepatocellular carcinoma. An upper endoscopy will be repeated in one year to screen for esophageal varices.
- Treatment planned for Issue 1: Continue furosemide 40 milligrams daily. Spironolactone will be restarted after obtaining clearance from his cardiologist. A low sodium diet of two grams per day and a fluid restriction of 1200 to 1500 cubic centimeters per day were strongly recommended. The importance of continued alcohol cessation was emphasized. A paracentesis was ordered to address the current fluid reaccumulation.
- Relevant referrals for Issue 1: A referral will be placed to Dr. Aziza Sarker for a liver transplant evaluation, given his high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score.
- List medications prescribed or discussed, with instructions: Furosemide 40 milligrams daily to continue. Spironolactone to be restarted pending cardiology clearance.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy, K72.90
- Assessment, likely diagnosis for Issue 2: Hepatic encephalopathy
- Treatment planned for Issue 2: Continue lactulose. It was advised to titrate the dose to achieve two to three soft bowel movements per day to avoid dehydration from excessive stools. It was recommended to discontinue MiraLAX and use only lactulose to manage bowel movements, titrating as needed for constipation.
- List medications prescribed or discussed, with instructions: Lactulose to be titrated for two to three soft bowel movements
daily.
3. Constipation
- continue lactulose and MIralax, family ntes if does not take periodic Miralax he gets constipated
4. Malnutrition
-suggested Glucerna for nutrtional supplements
A plan was established to manage his decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis. This includes aggressive medical management with diuretics, dietary restrictions including a two-gram sodium diet and fluid restriction, and continued alcohol abstinence. An abdominal ultrasound will be performed for hepatocellular carcinoma screening, and an upper endoscopy will be repeated in one year. Given a calculated Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score of 25, which indicates advanced liver disease, a referral will be made to Dr. Aziza Sarker for a liver transplant evaluation. His lactulose regimen was reviewed, with a recommendation to titrate the dose to aim for two to three soft bowel movements per day to manage hepatic encephalopathy while avoiding dehydration. We will re-evaluate in a six-week follow-up appointment to review the results of the planned investigations and assess his clinical progress.
Plan:
Follow-up office visit in 6 weeks
Low sodium diet, education provided
Fluid restriction to 1.2-1.5L per 24hrs
Continue lactulose
Will restart spironolactone once they establish care with cardiologist and receive clearance to restart.

Additional Notes:
The visit involved a comprehensive history and medical decision making of moderate complexity. A detailed history was obtained regarding his cirrhosis, complications including ascites and hepatic encephalopathy, recent hospitalizations, and current medication regimen. Multiple diagnoses were addressed, including decompensated cirrhosis, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. The management plan involves ordering and reviewing multiple laboratory tests and imaging studies, managing prescription medications with potential for significant complications, and initiating a referral for a major procedure (liver transplant evaluation). The risk of morbidity from the problems addressed is high."

- Treatment: We discussed the importance of dietary and lifestyle changes, specifically focusing on increasing dietary fiber intake to help manage symptoms and prevent exacerbation.
MILD GASTRITIS (ICD-10: K29.70)
- Assessment: Upper endoscopy revealed mild gastritis.
- Treatment: A food diary was recommended to identify potential dietary triggers. Treatment with pantoprazole 40 mg once daily was initiated. She was instructed to continue this for at least one month, with the goal of symptom improvement.
ESOPHAGITIS (ICD-10: K20.9) / GASTRITIS
- Assessment: Upper endoscopy revealed esophagitis / Gastritis
- Treatment: Management is concurrent with gastritis treatment, including the initiation of pantoprazole 40 mg daily and the recommendation to maintain a food diary.
CHOLELITHIASIS (ICD-10: K80.20)
- Assessment: An ultrasound of the abdomen confirmed the presence of gallstones (cholelithiasis) without any signs of acute inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis).
ELEVATED LIVER ENZYMES (ICD-10: R74.8)
- Assessment: Recent blood work showed that liver enzymes were mildly elevated.
- Treatment: I have encouraged her to reduce her alcohol consumption to help lower these enzymes.
Ms. Olguin was counseled on the results of her recent procedures and laboratory tests. For her gastritis and esophagitis, she was advised to start pantoprazole 40 mg by mouth once daily for a minimum of one month and to keep a food diary to track symptoms in relation to her diet. For the management of hemorrhoids and diverticulosis, the importance of increasing dietary fiber was emphasized. Regarding the elevated liver enzymes.

Blood in stool, abd pain, diarrhea, N/V
History of Present Illness:
Cecilia Beeson is a 72 year old female patient who is seen today for an initial visit to establish care for management of her long-standing irritable bowel syndrome and for a follow-up colonoscopy. She reports a history of irritable bowel symptoms since childhood, characterized exclusively by diarrhea; she denies ever experiencing constipation. Her symptoms have recently worsened, prompting this visit. Her last colonoscopy was five years ago, and her primary care provider is no longer willing to represcribe her dicyclomine, necessitating specialist care.
Cecilia has been taking dicyclomine since 2016, which she finds very effective for controlling severe abdominal cramping. She typically takes half a pill daily in the morning, but reports this is not always sufficient to control her symptoms, as she sometimes experiences 10-12 bowel movements a day. She has not tried taking the full prescribed dose routinely, as the only side effect she notices is increased thirst, which she manages by drinking a significant amount of water throughout the day. She does not consume alcohol. She has noted that dairy products are a definite trigger for her symptoms and has consequently reduced her milk intake and stopped eating ice cream about a year ago. Corn is also an occasional trigger. While fatty foods cause indigestion, she does not consume fried foods often.
In July 2025, while out of town, she experienced a sudden, severe episode of projectile diarrhea, vomiting, and saw bright red blood in the toilet. This episode was not preceded by cramping and lasted for a couple of hours. She took a full dose of dicyclomine, which helped to calm the symptoms. She experienced another episode of vomiting/diarrhea the following night. After returning home, she followed a BRAT diet for about a week. The pain associated with these episodes is consistently located in the left lower quadrant and is described as a severe, sharp, ripping sensation, as if a hot knife is being used.
Since the July episode, the frequency and severity of her symptoms have increased. She now experiences flare-ups approximately every week to week and a half, characterized by severe left-sided abdominal pain and multiple episodes of watery diarrhea. During a recent episode, she had nine bowel movements within 30 minutes. She reports that if she does not take dicyclomine during these episodes, the diarrhea can persist for hours. The medication typically provides relief within 15-20 minutes.
She has seen some blood with her bowel movements since the July episode, though not as significant. She also notes occasional dark stools. She reports a change in her stool caliber when she is not having diarrhea, describing it as being pencil-thin, about the size of her finger. Before July, her IBS episodes were almost a daily occurrence but were less severe and of shorter duration. A typical pattern involves having a bowel movement within 30 minutes to an hour after eating breakfast. She tries to eat her evening meal early to avoid sleep disturbances. Some associated bloating and mucous in stool.
There has been no unintentional weight loss; she reports weight gain. She denies fevers or chills since the initial severe episode in July. She does not have issues with heartburn, reflux, or dysphagia. Nausea and vomiting are not typical symptoms for her outside of the acute episode in July.
Her past medical history is significant for diverticulosis and internal hemorrhoids, noted on her last colonoscopy in 2021. She also reports using a CPAP machine since February 2025 for poor sleep, which has been effective.

Dietary counseling and surveillance
Assessment:
1. Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D), with recent worsening - K58.0
- Assessment: Longstanding history of IBS-D, likely with a superimposed post-infectious component following an episode of presumed acute gastroenteritis in July 2025. This has led to a flare in her baseline symptoms.
- Investigations planned for Issue 1: Colonoscopy to evaluate for other etiologies such as microscopic colitis and to assess the change in stool caliber.
- Treatment planned for Issue 1:
- Start dicyclomine 20 mg twice daily on a scheduled basis to prevent symptoms, rather than using it as a rescue medication. Counseled on the potential for increased dry mouth and the need to monitor for constipation.
- Initiate daily Benefiber, one dose in the morning, to act as a bulking agent to improve stool form and promote more complete evacuation.
- Recommend starting a daily probiotic to help stabilize gut flora and potentially reduce bloating. Advised to try different brands if the initial choice is not perceived as effective.
- The goal of these interventions is to reduce abdominal pain, cramping, and diarrheal frequency. If successful, the need for loperamide should decrease.
2. Rectal bleeding - K62.5
- Assessment: The bleeding is most likely secondary to internal hemorrhoids, which were documented on her prior colonoscopy. The explosive and frequent nature of her recent bowel movements has likely caused irritation.
- Investigations planned for Issue 2: The scheduled colonoscopy will also serve to rule out other causes of bleeding and directly visualize the anorectal area.
3. Diarrhea - R19.7
- Assessment: Symptom is multifactorial, related to underlying IBS and recent exacerbation.
- Treatment planned for Issue 3: Addressed with the plan for IBS-D management, including scheduled dicyclomine, fiber supplementation, and probiotics. Loperamide can be used for occasional rescue if needed.
This note was created in part by using voice recognition software and was reviewed by the medical provider to ensure accuracy.

Unable to eliminate completely, single episode of rectal blood
History of Present Illness:
Leona Coen is a 62 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit to discuss bowel habit changes and a recent episode of rectal bleeding. She was last seen in November 2023 for complaints of gas and bloating, at which time she had no bowel changes, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, or rectal bleeding. An ultrasound was performed at that time and was negative. A screening colonoscopy was scheduled for January 2024, but it was cancelled as her insurance would not provide coverage, stating it was too soon since her last one in 2016, which they require every 10 years for screening purposes.
Over the past year, she has noticed a change in her bowel habits. She describes a sensation of incomplete evacuation, feeling as though stool remains in the rectum after a bowel movement. She reports needing to strain and push to pass stool, and sometimes has to move around to facilitate defecation. She can feel the stool in the lower rectal area, where it feels like it ""just stops."" When she does have a bowel movement, the stool can be large or in little pieces. She has a bowel movement daily and denies constipation or diarrhea. There is no associated abdominal pain. She is able to pass flatus without difficulty. The gas and bloating she experienced previously have resolved.
Last week, she noted a single episode of a small amount of dry blood on her underwear. She also noted a small amount of blood upon wiping. She has not had any recurrence of bleeding since this episode. She believes she may have been straining significantly during the bowel movement at that time.
She denies any associated upper gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, or heartburn. She also denies any unintentional weight loss. Her past medical history is significant for a colonoscopy in 2016. She currently takes Metamucil, one tablespoon daily.

Diagnosis:
Change in bowel habit
Hematochezia
HTN (hypertension)
Assessment:
1. Change in bowel habits with incomplete evacuation - K59.89
- Assessment: Suspected pelvic floor dysfunction. The symptoms of straining, sensation of incomplete evacuation, and the feeling of anorectal obstruction are highly suggestive of this condition, where anatomical changes in the pelvic floor, such as a rectocele, can create a pouch that traps stool.
- Investigations planned: A colonoscopy is warranted to rule out any intraluminal pathology that could be contributing to her obstructive defecation symptoms, and to evaluate for a source of her recent rectal bleeding.
- Treatment planned: I recommended increasing fiber intake to bulk the stool and promote more complete evacuation. She is currently taking one tablespoon of Metamucil daily. I advised her to double this dose, either by taking it twice a day or taking two tablespoons at once with plenty of water. We will defer consideration of other interventions, such as surgical repair, at this time.
2. Rectal bleeding - K62.5
- Assessment: Likely secondary to straining or hemorrhoids, given the isolated nature of the event and the description of dry blood.
- Investigations planned: Colonoscopy will be performed to definitively rule out other colonic sources of bleeding, such as polyp or inflammation..

gastritis, fatty liver disease
History of Present Illness:
8 minutes spent on telehealth visit, consent verbally obtained, conducted by audio and VIDEO, patient participated in call, location of patient is home, and location of provider is 1015 Medical Center Blvd., Suite 1300, Webster TX 77598
Mr. Hopper presents for a follow-up visit to discuss the results of recent investigations. The primary purpose of the visit is to review findings from recent blood work, a liver ultrasound, a FibroScan, and an upper endoscopy, and to establish a corresponding management plan. He reports experiencing symptoms of extra gas and discomfort, which he attributes to his history of a Toupet fundoplication, as this procedure prevents retrograde gas relief through eructation, leading to a sensation of bloating and gastric distention.
Recent laboratory studies, including a comprehensive metabolic panel, liver function tests, and complete blood count, were reviewed and found to be within normal limits. Specifically, glucose was 93. An ultrasound of the liver was performed, which demonstrated evidence of hepatic steatosis, but was otherwise unremarkable with no evidence of malignancy. A FibroScan was also conducted to quantify the degree of steatosis and fibrosis. The results indicated S3 steatosis, consistent with moderate fatty liver, but minimal fibrosis, suggesting a low risk for long-term liver damage or cirrhosis. An upper endoscopy revealed mild, localized inflammation within the stomach, consistent with gastritis. Biopsies were obtained during the procedure, and histopathological examination confirmed mild inflammation with no evidence of malignancy or infection. The inflammation is considered likely secondary to dietary factors.
His past medical history is significant for a Toupet fundoplication, which is noted to affect his current symptoms of gas and bloating by mechanically preventing upward gas release from the stomach. He reports not taking many medications and is actively trying to minimize their use.

Diagnosis:
Gastritis, unspecified, without bleeding (e)
History of fundoplication
Fatty liver
Assessment:
MILD GASTRITIS K29.70
- The assessment is that the mild, localized gastritis found on upper endoscopy is likely related to dietary intake, including fatty foods, spicy foods, and potentially alcohol. The patient's symptoms of gas and bloating may be exacerbated by the gastritis. Due to a prior Toupet fundoplication, he is unable to burp, which can worsen discomfort from gas buildup.
- Treatment for the gastritis was discussed. A prescription for pantoprazole (Protonix) 40 mg will be sent to his preferred pharmacy. It was explained that this medication can be taken for a two-week course when symptoms are present to help reduce stomach inflammation. After the initial course, he can use it on an as-needed basis for symptom flares, particularly during holidays or periods of dietary indiscretion. It was emphasized that he is not obligated to take the medication and can manage his symptoms with dietary modifications if he prefers. Taking pantoprazole may also alleviate the sensations of bloating and distention.
- Education was provided regarding lifestyle modifications. He was counseled to avoid fatty and spicy foods, and to be particularly cautious with alcohol consumption, as it can directly irritate the stomach lining and worsen gastritis.
NON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE (NAFLD) K76.0
- The assessment is moderate hepatic steatosis (S3 on FibroScan) without significant fibrosis. The liver appears otherwise normal on ultrasound, with no signs of cancer. This is a low-risk finding for long-term liver damage at present.
- Investigations will include a repeat FibroScan in approximately three years to monitor the status of the fatty liver. He was also advised to ensure his primary care provider includes liver function tests as part of his annual physical examinations.
- Education was provided regarding management of fatty liver disease. He was advised to avoid fatty foods and alcohol, engage in regular exercise, and maintain a healthy weight to help manage this condition.
The patient was counseled that his sensation of extra gas and discomfort is likely related to his past Toupet fundoplication. This procedure, by design, prevents reflux and eructation. Therefore, any gas or food in the stomach must either build up, causing distention, or pass distally. The prescribed pantoprazole may help alleviate some of this bloating and discomfort by treating the underlying gastritis. He was encouraged to try the medication to see if it provides relief.
A prescription for pantoprazole (Protonix) 40 mg has been called into CVS Pharmacy in Deer Park. He was instructed to take one tablet daily for two weeks during a symptomatic flare-up and then as needed thereafter. He was advised that if dietary changes alone control his symptoms, the medication is not necessary. He was counseled to call if any problems arise.
Plan:
Protonix 40 mg Take 1 tablet by mouth every morning 30 min before meals
Create a food diary.
Monitor clinical course and call with any problems or worsening symptoms in the interim.
Additional Notes:

Hospital Follow Up
History of Present Illness:
Pamela Phillips is a 72 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit. This is a follow-up visit for Ms. Pamela Phillips after a recent hospitalization for intractable vomiting and abdominal pain. She was admitted to the hospital on or around 08/20/2025. During her hospitalization, a computed tomography scan revealed severe thickening of the esophageal lining, which was thought to be secondary to vomiting and potential acid reflux. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed on 08/29/2025, which demonstrated severe inflammation in the middle and lower third of the esophagus, along with some inflammation in the stomach. Biopsies taken from the esophagus showed inflammatory changes. It was suspected that her use of Mounjaro might have been a contributing factor to her symptoms, as it can delay gastric emptying and exacerbate reflux.
Since being discharged from the hospital, her nausea and vomiting have completely resolved. She reports a single, fleeting episode of sharp pain under her rib cage yesterday, which resolved quickly on its own. She has been adhering to a careful diet. There has been no significant impact on her daily activities since her symptoms have improved. She denies any other associated symptoms Review of systems is negative for hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, odynophagia, fecal urgency, unexplained weight loss, fever, and chills. A computed tomography scan from 08/2025 showed severe thickening of the lining of the esophagus. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed on 08/29/2025 revealed severe inflammation in the middle and lower third of the esophagus and some inflammation of the stomach. Biopsies of the esophagus showed inflammation. She has a family history of esophageal cancer, as her brother passed away from this disease two to three years ago.
PAST SUMMARY: 03/11/2025
Pamela J. Phillips presents for a recall colonoscopy. She had a colonoscopy in 2023 which showed multiple polyps, all of which were tubular adenomas on pathology. At that time, a 3-year follow-up was recommended. However, she received a recall notice to return after 2 years, prompting this visit. She denies any new gastrointestinal complaints.She reports having hard stools about once a week since starting Miralax 4-6 months ago. Miralax and fiber supplementation help alleviate this issue.
Pamela has an extensive family history of various cancers, though genetic testing with Dr. Mahmood last year was negative. Her siblings have been diagnosed with esophageal, bladder, colon, and pancreatic cancers. She herself has a history of lung cancer.  Review of systems is negative for hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, odynophagia, fecal urgency, unexplained weight loss, fever, and chills. Past medical history is significant for lung cancer.

Dietary counseling and surveillance
Assessment:
Discussed in detail with the patient regarding EGD results. Discussed in detail with the patient regarding their CT-Abdomen/Pelvis results. Discussed in detail with the patient regarding their lab results Discussed in detail with the patient regarding pathology results. I have discussed with patient in detail the current diagnosis and differential diagnosis.
1. Esophagitis and Gastritis, K20.9, K29.70
- Assessment: Severe esophagitis and gastritis, likely multifactorial, potentially exacerbated by Mounjaro use. Her symptoms have significantly improved with current medical management.
- Investigations planned: A repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy is planned in approximately eight weeks, toward the end of October 2025, to ensure adequate healing of the esophagus.
- Treatment planned: Continue proton pump inhibitor therapy to promote healing. Discontinuation of Mounjaro is recommended at this time to remove a potential contributing factor. The medication can be reconsidered in the future after the esophagus has healed and she has fully recovered.
- Medications prescribed or discussed, with instructions: Pantoprazole was refilled for several months to ensure a full course of treatment for at least eight weeks. She is instructed to take it once daily, 30 minutes before breakfast. She will continue taking sucralfate as prescribed. It was decided to discontinue famotidine to simplify the medication regimen, with the plan to monitor for any return of nighttime reflux symptoms.
2. Surveillance colonoscopy, Z12.11
- Assessment: Routine high-risk screening due to personal history of adenomatous polyps and strong family history of GI malignancy
- Plan: Proceed with colonoscopy in 1 year (2026) as originally planned, 3 years from last colonoscopy in 2023.
3. Constipation, K59.00
- Assessment: Constipation, likely secondary to Mounjaro use
- Treatment: Continue Miralax and fiber supplementation as needed for symptom control. Counseled on potential constipating effects of Miralax.
4. Overweight
-diet and exercise for weight reduction advised
Plan:
EGD with Anesthesia Provider/CRNA who is hereby directed and authorized to administer anesthesia - 43235
Risks and benefits statement: The procedure and its preparation, benefits, alternatives, and limitations were explained to the patient or legal guardian. The risks and potential complications including but not limited to perforation, bleeding, infection, missed lesion, aspiration and other complications of sedation were reviewed. The patient or legal guardian verbalized understanding and wishes to proceed.

Additional Notes:
This was a detailed follow-up visit for a patient with a complex new problem requiring detailed history review, review of outside hospital records, and extensive discussion regarding management options. The total time spent on this encounter was significant, involving data review and prolonged counseling. The level of medical decision making was moderate, given the need to manage a new problem with uncertain prognosis, review of test results, prescription drug management, and the decision for a major procedure."

Follow up
History of Present Illness:
This is a 64-year-old female for follow-up. Her last visit was in April 2025. Since that visit, she underwent a robotic sigmoid colectomy on 06/05/2025 with Dr. Maryann Cusick for symptomatic diverticulosis with a redundant colon and fixed pelvic loops. She reports that her prior abdominal pain symptoms related to the diverticulosis have resolved since the surgery. Her current chief complaint is a recent urinary tract infection. She was treated with an initial antibiotic which was ineffective, and she is currently on a second antibiotic for an E. coli UTI, with the course finishing this Thursday. The culture results were the same on both tests. This has raised her concern for a possible colo-vesicular fistula, a small leak between the colon and the bladder, as a complication of her recent surgery. She denies a history of chronic UTIs. Her other ongoing issue is discomfort from a hiatal hernia. She is seeking a surgical repair for the hernia this year but is against the previously recommended gastric bypass procedure due to concerns about potential complications. She has a history of a gastric sleeve procedure performed over 20 years ago. She is currently taking both pantoprazole 40 mg and over-the-counter omeprazole 20 mg with sodium bicarbonate for her reflux symptoms. She also takes meloxicam regularly for arthritis and joint pain, and was unaware that this medication can exacerbate acid reflux and abdominal discomfort.
Prior Tests Reviewed:
- Colonoscopy on 09/2024 showed significant diverticulosis and a redundant colon, which was difficult to navigate but a complete examination to the cecum was performed.
- Bone density scan in January 2025 was reported as normal for her age.
4/14/2025 This is a telehealth visit being conducted at the request of patient from my office (11920 Astoria Blvd, St 410, Houston 77089) using audio only communication since video is unavailable. Appropriate consent was obtained. This is a routine follow-up after 2 months. In the meantime she had a CT scan abdomen/pelvis which showed peripancreatic cyst likely representing pseudocyst, colonic diverticulosis also evident without diverticulitis. Recommend repeat imaging in 1 year for cyst surveillance. She followed up with colorectal surgery as discussed previously and is considering having partial colectomy given severe diverticulosis and redundant colon with severe tortuosity during prior colonoscopy. She remains on lactulose at a low dose with good results and she should continue the same for now. She also saw a bariatric surgeon Dr. Cowling to discuss severe reflux post gastric sleeve. He discussed the possibility of conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass however she is concerned about possible adverse effects with another bariatric surgery. Particularly she is hesitant to avoid NSAIDs given issues with chronic joint pain. She would like to keep her follow up appointment with GI that is scheduled this summer.
2/21/2025 This is a telehealth visit being conducted at the request of patient from my office (11920 Astoria Blvd, St 410, Houston 77089) using audio only communication since video is unavailable. Appropriate consent was obtained. This is a follow-up visit after 4 months. In the meantime she continues to struggle with reflux symptoms and reports very limited intake of food and liquids after bariatric sleeve surgery in 2008, worsening over time. She feels that she can only drink small sips of liquids and eat processed foods like crackers most of the day otherwise she will have severe regurgitation. PPI is helpful for heartburn. Recent endoscopy did not show any significant esophagitis or ulcers but she does have a small hiatal hernia. She takes meloxicam 15 mg once a day for arthritis which may be exacerbating her symptoms however current symptoms preceded this. Recommended increasing PPI to 40mg pantoprazole daily and she may continue once daily omeprazole in the evenings if needed.  I recommended seeing a bariatric specialist given the high likelihood of nutrient deficiencies and to discuss the possibility of revision surgery such as a bypass given her ongoing symptoms. She should also discuss alternates to NSAID therapy with prescribing physician
10/15/24 She is here for procedure follow-up after recent EGD and colonoscopy. Reviewed procedure findings including gaping lower esophageal sphincter, small hiatal hernia, mild gastritis. Biopsies were negative for H. pylori and Barrett's esophagus. Colonoscopy revealed severe diverticulosis in the descending colon with loopy colon, pelvic adhesions, otherwise normal colonoscopy without large polyps. Surprisingly patient denies any constipation generally. She has regular bowel movements but reports sensation of incomplete evacuation that occurs often. Denies any diarrhea or abdominal pain. Discussed fiber supplementation, increase fluids and stool softeners as needed. If she becomes more symptomatic in the future she may benefit from colorectal surgery consultation to discuss partial colectomy. Further screening colonoscopies were not recommended unless she has a partial resection in the future due to severe tortuosity of the colon and risk for perforation. She has had significant acid reflux issues ever since her gastric sleeve and has worsened with weight gain over time. She remains on omeprazole 40 mg a day with moderate benefit. She states that her diet and fluid intake are very limited given prior bariatric surgery. She is unable to drink much fluids. She does not drink any water and drinks some tea throughout the day. If reflux symptoms worsen in the future she may benefit from bariatric surgery consultation to discuss the possibility of conversion to a gastric bypass. We had a very detailed discussion regarding lifestyle modifications which may benefit her symptoms. I also answered a variety of her questions using poster of GI anatomy in the room.
07/31/2024 Patient is a female with a history of gastric sleeve surgery in 2008, presenting for a routine visit to set up a screening colonoscopy. She has not had a colonoscopy since 2016 due to loss of insurance coverage in December 2019. She is now insured and wishes to proceed with the screening.
Patient has been experiencing severe acid reflux symptoms, which are effectively managed with 40 mg of over-the-counter omeprazole daily, including one pill that contains sodium bicarbonate. If she misses a dose, she experiences a sensation of a ""big wad of burning something"" in her throat within a few hours.
Patient reports occasional episodes every 3-4 months where her ""intestines get upset."" A few years ago, she visited the emergency room due to severe discomfort, and was informed that she had an infection in her intestine.
Patient has a history of significant weight fluctuations following her gastric sleeve surgery. She initially weighed 206 pounds, dropped to 106 pounds, maintained a weight of around 120 pounds for a few years, and then experienced a gradual increase to 170 pounds. She is currently maintaining a weight of around 158-160 pounds.

Assessment:
Assessment & Plan:
1. Follow-up post-sigmoid colectomy for diverticulosis - Z09
- Symptoms of abdominal pain have resolved post-operatively. The primary goal of the surgery, which was to straighten the colon for easier future colonoscopies and prevent diverticulitis-related complications, has been achieved.
- No further colonoscopy is indicated at this time just to confirm the colon is straightened.
- A colonoscopy would be considered if a urology evaluation for recurrent UTIs raises suspicion for a colo-vesicular fistula.
2. Recurrent urinary tract infection - N39.0
- This is a new issue post-colectomy. She is concerned about a possible colo-vesicular fistula.
- Differential diagnosis includes nephrolithiasis or ureterolithiasis, anatomical urinary tract issues, or a colo-vesicular fistula.
- A colonoscopy is not sensitive enough to visualize a small fistula.
- Recommended referral to a urologist for further evaluation if UTIs persist or recur after the current treatment course is completed.
3. Hiatal hernia with gastroesophageal reflux disease - K44.9
- Experiences ongoing discomfort from the hiatal hernia. Desires surgical correction but is opposed to gastric bypass.
- A standard Nissen fundoplication is not feasible due to her remote history of a gastric sleeve gastrectomy, which removed the fundus of the stomach. The gastric bypass is the appropriate surgical option if symptoms are severe enough to warrant intervention. The risks and benefits of this procedure were discussed, including the high likelihood that other repairs, such as suturing the diaphragm or using mesh, would fail due to the constant movement of the diaphragm.
- Will continue medical management. Sent a refill for pantoprazole 40 mg to Express Scripts as requested. She will continue to purchase omeprazole 20 mg with sodium bicarbonate over the counter.
- She inquired about taking two pantoprazole 40 mg tablets daily. She was counseled that this would further increase her risk for osteoporosis.
4. Chronic NSAID use - M19.90
- She takes meloxicam regularly for arthritis pain.
- Counseled that NSAIDs like meloxicam can worsen acid reflux and cause abdominal discomfort. She was previously unaware of this side effect.
- Advised to discuss alternative pain management strategies with her rheumatologist.
Plan:
Renew pantoprazole 40 mg Take 1 tablet by mouth once a day 30 min before breakfast
Potential side effects of a PPI were discussed with patient regarding long-term safety.

Assessment:
I have reviewed available records and discussed them with patient. We have discussed current clinical scenario and the differential diagnosis.
1. Dysphagia with solids and liquids:
- Concerning for esophageal pathology given chronicity and progression
- Plan for upper endoscopy to evaluate esophageal structure and function
- Consider barium swallow study if endoscopy is non-diagnostic
- Will coordinate with nephrology team regarding procedure preparation given ESRD
2. Weight loss:
- Likely secondary to dysphagia
- Will monitor weight closely
- Consider nutritional consultation for dietary modifications and supplementation
- Assess for other contributing factors at follow-up
3. End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis:
- Continue current dialysis regimen at Fresenius
- Coordinate with nephrology regarding medication adjustments for planned procedures
- Consider renal-specific nutritional recommendations
4. Preventive care:
- Due for colonoscopy (last one 6 years ago)
- Will schedule colonoscopy along with upper endoscopy
- Discussed bowel preparation challenges; will use renal-appropriate preparation
Follow-up: Patient to return after completion of endoscopy and colonoscopy to discuss results and further management. Will coordinate with dialysis center regarding scheduling of procedures.
Plan:
EGD with dilation/Colonoscopy with Anesthesia Provider/CRNA who is hereby directed and authorized to administer anesthesia - 43249/45378 at hospital on a Friday; pt has dialysis TTS.  pt was advised to start clear liquid diet 36 hours prior to exam; dulcolax + golytely
Risks and benefits statement: The procedure and its preparation, benefits, alternatives, and limitations were explained to the patient or legal guardian. The risks and potential complications including but not limited to perforation, bleeding, infection, missed lesion, aspiration and other complications of sedation were reviewed. The patient or legal guardian verbalized understanding and wishes to proceed.

Follow up
History of Present Illness:
Patient is seen in follow-up regarding chronic intermittent constipation. She has a bowel movement mostly daily but will skip a day sometimes with difficulty to evacuate stools and straining. She will also get a low back pain when she is constipated. She will still have her epigastric pain off-and-on which does not bother her too much. She has not been taking any antacids. She remains on methimazole for hyperthyroidism. She had MRI pelvis done 12/2024 for low back pain which showed L5-S1 disc protrusion, colonic diverticulosis, fibroid uterus. Labs done with endocrinologist 2 weeks ago not available for review. She would like to pursue screening colonoscopy at this time, wants to do it after she comes back from Spain in the next few weeks..
04/12/2024 Patient is seen in follow-up after recent lab and endoscopic evaluation for upper abdominal pain and elevated LFTs.  Labs 1/18/2024 revealed improving LFTs with ALT 70, AST 19, rest CMP, CBC, CLD workup negative. TSH 0.01 with free T4 3.1. EGD 1/22/2024 with small hiatal hernia, Hill grade 3, mild gastritis HP/celiac negative. USG abdomen complete 3/27/2024 status post CCK, fatty liver. Her symptoms have completely resolved at this time. CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast was canceled by endocrinologist to avoid iodinated contrast load in setting of hyperparathyroidism. She is currently on methimazole. She tells me that her LFTs were elevated on methimazole and dose had to be reduced, subsequent labs revealed improvement. She has been given Cologuard by PCP and does not want to pursue colonoscopy at this time.
1/18/24 Patient presents for initial visit after recent ER visit 01/13/24 for epigastric pain ongoing for 3 days. Pain was exacerbated with food intake. She also had some nausea as well as several episodes of diarrhea. Symptoms started after eating some catfish. Labs at the ER - 01/13/2024 ALT 164, AST 37, rest CMP, CBC, UA, HS troponin, pregnancy ok. No imaging was completed. She was discharged with dicyclomine, pantoprazole, and famotidine. Her epigastric pain has improved at this time and occurs mostly with deep breaths. She denies any further nausea or diarrhea.  She also had more recent labs with her OB/GYN - 01/12/24 HbA1c 6.1, ALT 133, AST 40, AST 40, TSH 0.006, T4 2.59, rest CMP, CBC ok. She had an EGD about 15 years ago. She has not had a colonoscopy before. She denies any family hx of colon cancer.  She has been having shoulder pain and was taking meloxicam daily for several months. She has also been taking BC powder several times per week for headaches. She denies any smoking or alcohol use. She denies any cardiac conditions or symptoms. She has seen cardiologist Dr. Tayyan and has had an ECHO done recently.  She has been taking unicity supplements which she has now d/c.

History of Present Illness:
Mary Prudhome is a 58 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit. Had surgery on ankle ligaments in May, in walking boot of left leg. She fell in August and and had some lower back pain and left-sided abdominal pain afterwards. She went to the ER on 8/20/25. CT showed small bilateral pleural effusions, small pericardial effusion seen, scattered hepatic cysts measuring up to 2.3 cm, s/p cholecystectomy, atherosclerosis, large amount of stool present, osteopenia and mild degenerative changes in the spine. Hgb 12.7, normal LFT's, and normal CRP.
She continues to complain of hoarseness, trouble swallowing with solids and liquids, and poorly controlled reflux on pantoprazole 40 mg daily. Had been on omeprazole 40 mg daily prior without relief. Normal EGD 4/15/25, dilated to 60 fr w/out resistance. Esophageal manometry 5/2/25 showed EGJ outflow obstruction. Barium esophagram 6/4/25 was normal. She was referred to Baylor GI, but has never received a phone call.
She has loose stool and takes something for constipation once daily, thinks it is Miralax. Denies constipation, lower abdominal pain, or bloody stool. Has had flare ups of her hemorrhoids and is requesting something stronger than Preparation H.  Has seen some black stool since she fell, not with every BM. Denies any Pepto use. She is no longer on Ozempic.
Her last colonoscopy was on 1/12/24 with Dr. Chennupati for complaints of severe constipation/abnormal CT. Findings were a fair colon prep with normal-appearing colon and normal biopsies. Recall 10 years. Fecal calprotectin Feb 2024 was 33. Capsule endoscopy 2/22/24 showed multiple AVM's in the SI, but no evidence of IBD.

celiac disease
History of Present Illness:
Mr. Unverzagt presents for a follow-up visit to discuss the results of his recent upper endoscopy and colonoscopy. The procedures were performed due to a reported change in his bowel habits, and the primary goal was to rule out any concerning pathology such as colon cancer or polyps. He reports that since the procedures, his bowel movements have been improving and he is starting to have solid bowel movements again. He also inquired about a sensation of excessive phlegm in the back of his throat.
The colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) were performed on 09/25/2025. The colonoscopy was macroscopically normal throughout the entire colon, with no evidence of colon cancer or polyps. Biopsies taken from the colon were also normal, showing no signs of inflammation or malignancy. The upper endoscopy revealed mild inflammation in the stomach, described as congestion. Given a history of celiac disease, biopsies were also obtained from the small bowel. These small bowel biopsies were positive for elevated intraepithelial lymphocytes, which is consistent with inflammation secondary to gluten exposure in a patient with celiac disease. The inflammation is not severe. Liver function tests were checked and were normal.
He has a known history of celiac disease and reports that he has been on a strict gluten-free diet, although he acknowledges occasionally eating something he shouldn't.

Change in bowel habits

Screening for colon cancer (c)
Family history of colon cancer
Assessment:
CELIAC DISEASE K90.0
- The findings from the small bowel biopsy, specifically the elevated intraepithelial lymphocytes, indicate ongoing inflammation consistent with gluten exposure despite his attempts to follow a gluten-free diet. The recent change in bowel habits, including diarrhea, is likely attributable to this gluten contamination. He was extensively educated on the critical importance of a strict, 100% gluten-free diet. The discussion covered the high risk of cross-contamination, even from minute amounts of gluten, particularly when dining out or in a household with non-celiac individuals. It was explained that commercial kitchens, even those offering ""gluten-free"" options, often cannot prevent cross-contamination from utensils, preparation surfaces, or airborne particles. Similarly, gluten can be inadvertently transferred within his own home. He was counseled that with age, sensitivity to gluten can increase. The long-term risks of non-compliance, including an increased risk of lymphoma, were reviewed to emphasize the medical necessity of strict dietary adherence. He was advised to be highly cautious and was informed about celiac support groups that rate restaurants, though it was stressed that complete avoidance is the only certain method.
NORMAL COLONOSCOPY Z86.010
- The colonoscopy performed on 09/25/2025 was normal, with no polyps, cancer, or inflammation identified. Colon biopsies were also negative. He was advised that he can have his next screening colonoscopy in 10 years. A reminder will be sent to him.
MILD GASTRITIS K29.70
- The upper endoscopy revealed mild inflammation in the stomach. This may be contributing to some mild reflux symptoms. The primary focus of management is on his celiac disease, which is the more significant finding.
SENSATION OF PHLEGM IN THROAT R05.3
- He expressed concern about a sensation of excessive phlegm in his throat. It was explained that the endoscope used for the EGD is designed to evaluate the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine, and is not the ideal instrument for examining the oropharyngeal area behind the tongue. While no abnormalities were seen in the visualized portion of the upper esophagus, the scope has a low detection rate (approximately 60%) for pathology in the throat area. Given his persistent symptoms, a referral to an Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) specialist was recommended for a formal evaluation of the oropharynx, as they utilize specialized equipment for this purpose. It was clarified that there is no evidence of pathology from the esophagus downward.
Mr. Unverzagt was advised to maintain a very strict gluten-free diet to manage his celiac disease and prevent long-term complications. He was instructed to schedule a follow-up colonoscopy in 10 years. He was also strongly encouraged to see an ENT specialist for evaluation of his throat symptoms. Follow-up is scheduled on an as-needed basis.
Plan:
Colonoscopy in 10 years
Continue gluten free diet
Monitor clinical course and call with any problems or worsening symptoms in the interim.
Additional Notes:
E&M Code: 99214 - Established Patient, Office Visit. This visit involves a detailed history, review of multiple procedure results (colonoscopy, EGD with biopsies), and extensive counseling on a chronic condition (Celiac disease) with significant lifestyle implications. The medical decision making is moderate due to the need to interpret diagnostic tests, manage a chronic illness with exacerbation, and coordinate potential referral. The discussion involved analysis of biopsy results leading to a change in management, and counseling on the risk of long-term complications (lymphoma), justifying a moderate level of complexity."

abdominal pain, h pylori negative, colonoscopy
History of Present Illness:
Mr. Edwards presents for evaluation of upper abdominal tenderness and to discuss screening procedures. He reports developing an ulcer issue, which he believes was precipitated by taking aspirin and Advil for two to three weeks for severe back pain. Initially, this was associated with a significant stinging sensation, which has since subsided. He denies any signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, such as melena or hematochezia.
His current primary concern is tenderness localized to the right upper quadrant, in the area of his liver. This tenderness is something he has noticed and is concerned about. He reports a habit of frequently palpating or pressing on this area. He denies associated symptoms such as nausea or vomiting. He also denies any recent weight loss or the use of any new medications, including weight loss medications, that could account for his symptoms. He reports a persistent, low-level discomfort in the upper abdomen even during the consultation. He also notes a diastasis recti, which he can voluntarily make more prominent, and questions if this could be related to the tenderness. The symptoms do not appear to significantly impact his daily activities, as he works from home.
A recent wellness check included blood work, which was reportedly normal except for a slightly elevated cholesterol level and a hemoglobin A1c of 5.7%, placing him at the threshold of pre-diabetes. He was also tested for the bacteria that can cause ulcers, and this test was negative. No ultrasound was performed at that time.
His last esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was in 2018 and showed some mild inflammation. He is also due for a screening colonoscopy.

Screening for colon cancer (c)
Assessment:
ABDOMINAL PAIN R10.9
- The presentation of right upper quadrant tenderness requires further evaluation to rule out hepatobiliary pathology, as well as to investigate for a potential peptic ulcer given his history of NSAID use and prior gastritis. The contribution of his diastasis recti to the tenderness is possible but less likely to be the primary cause.
- Investigations: An abdominal ultrasound will be ordered to evaluate the liver, gallbladder, and other upper abdominal organs. An EGD will be performed to assess for gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, or other upper GI pathology, particularly given the history of inflammation on his 2018 scope. A screening colonoscopy is also due and will be performed concurrently.
- Treatment: Management will be guided by the results of the upcoming investigations.
SCREENING FOR MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF COLON Z12.11
- He is due for a screening colonoscopy.
- Investigations: A colonoscopy will be performed. This will be scheduled at the same time as the EGD for patient convenience.
A comprehensive discussion was held with Mr. Edwards regarding the rationale for the recommended procedures. It was explained that the abdominal ultrasound is necessary to evaluate the liver and gallbladder given his right upper quadrant tenderness. The EGD is indicated to investigate the source of his upper abdominal pain and assess the status of his previous gastritis, while the colonoscopy is due for routine screening. He understood the reasoning for performing both endoscopic procedures during the same session and consented to the plan. He was advised that he will need a driver to and from the procedure.
The plan is to schedule an abdominal ultrasound. An EGD and colonoscopy are scheduled for 09/30/2025. A procedure time of approximately 8:30 AM will be requested to accommodate his need to take his son to school in the morning. He will receive a follow-up appointment approximately two weeks after the procedures to discuss the results. His preferred pharmacy is Walgreens in Texas City.

Medical decision-making was of moderate complexity, involving the evaluation of a new problem with additional workup planned (ultrasound, EGD, colonoscopy), and the analysis of data from a recent wellness check. The decision to proceed with multiple diagnostic procedures contributes to the complexity."

GERD , H/o colon polyps
History of Present Illness:
Manuel is a 65-year-old male presenting for a follow-up visit. He was last seen in this clinic in October 2023 for a colonoscopy. He is here today to schedule a repeat surveillance colonoscopy as recommended. During his prior colonoscopy two years ago, polyps were found and removed. The pathology report indicated these were precancerous adenomas, not cancer. One polyp on the right side of the colon was noted to be large and required dye injection for removal. Due to the size and nature of the polyps, a repeat colonoscopy in two years was recommended to ensure the removal site has healed properly with no new growth and to screen for any new polyps in the rest of the colon.
His medical history is otherwise unchanged over the past two years. He continues to take medication for hypertension and high cholesterol. He is not on any blood thinners or weight loss medications. He also takes omeprazole for acid reflux, which he reports taking every night. He experiences reflux symptoms if he misses a dose, particularly when lying down at night. A discussion was had regarding his longstanding history of reflux and the potential benefit of an upper endoscopy (EGD) to evaluate the esophagus for a possible hiatal hernia or other causes of reflux, and to screen for any acid-induced damage to the esophageal lining, such as Barrett's esophagus. The recommendation was made to perform the EGD at the same time as the colonoscopy for convenience. It was explained that the surveillance colonoscopy and the EGD may not be fully covered by insurance and could be applied to his deductible. He agreed to have both procedures ordered and will decide whether to proceed after insurance approval is obtained.
Prior Tests Reviewed:
- Colonoscopy (October 2023): Findings included multiple polyps, including a large adenomatous polyp on the right side of the colon which was removed. Pathology confirmed precancerous adenoma. Recommendation was for a repeat colonoscopy in 2 years.
10/25/2023 Patient is here for procedure follow up appointment. Colonoscopy in 10/23 with tubular adenomas (largest 2cm), small internal hemorrhoids. Recall colonoscopy for surveillance in 2 years. Today, patient denies abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, visible GI bleeding. Follow up as needed.
08/31/2023 The patient has a history of colonic polyps and is here to schedule surveillance colonoscopy. They have no history of heart attack, stroke, or pulmonary conditions, and are on no anticoagulants or antiplatelet medications.
09/22/2021 Patient is here for average risk colon cancer screening evaluation. No prior colonoscopy. No BRBPR or melena. No constipation or diarrhea. No abdominal pain. Discussion with patient regarding colon cancer screening rationale, explanation of colonoscopy & bowel prep, also informed consent including potential risks, benefits, & alternatives of colonoscopy. Stool test + cologuard. No bleeding.

Results on BIopsy
History of Present Illness:
This is a follow-up visit to review the results of a recent upper endoscopy. The primary complaints are ongoing nausea and vomiting. The nausea and vomiting are intermittent. Last week, episodes of vomiting occurred for three consecutive days, and on some days, it happened twice. The timing is unpredictable and has recently occurred at work, whereas previously it was confined to home. The episodes are preceded by his mouth watering, after which he feels there is a 50% chance he will vomit. The symptoms are having a significant impact, causing him to feel unwell for about an hour after each episode. He reports that he was taking Protonix and initially felt it was providing relief, but then experienced a recurrence of vomiting for two straight days.
The upper endoscopy revealed an irritated stomach with red spots, consistent with gastritis. Biopsies were taken from the inflamed areas, and the pathology confirmed gastritis or gastropathy. The biopsy results were negative for infection and cancer. A CT scan from the end of July 2025 demonstrated an abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 4.6 cm, as well as gallbladder inflammation and thickening. Blood work from July 2025 was reportedly normal. Prior blood work from several months ago showed evidence of mild pancreatic irritation, but a follow-up CT scan showed the pancreas was normal. The patient reports minimal alcohol intake, stating he does not drink during the week but had some beer on the weekend. He reports a history of smoking but quit over 12 years ago.

Gastritis, unspecified, without bleeding (e)
Abnormal CT scan, gallbladder
Assessment:
GASTRITIS K29.70
- The upper endoscopy and subsequent biopsies confirmed the presence of gastritis, which is likely a contributor to the nausea and vomiting.
- I will continue the current prescription for Protonix to be taken daily before a meal. A new prescription for Dicyclomine was also provided to be taken on an as-needed basis for acute episodes of nausea and abdominal discomfort. It was explained that this medication should work within about 30 minutes.
ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM, WITHOUT RUPTURE I71.4
- The CT scan from July 2025 revealed an abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 4.6 cm. The significant risk of rupture and mortality associated with this condition was discussed at length. It was explained that this aneurysm could be a cause of his symptoms and that it will continue to grow with age.
- A referral to a vascular surgeon for urgent evaluation was strongly recommended, with the advice to schedule an appointment before the end of the month. The vascular surgeon will determine the timing and necessity of surgical repair versus watchful monitoring.
The patient was counseled extensively on the seriousness of the abdominal aortic aneurysm, emphasizing that it is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention from a specialist. The potential causes of the aneurysm, including genetics, a history of high blood pressure, and smoking, were discussed. It was also strongly recommended that he abstain completely from alcohol, as it can exacerbate gastritis and has previously been associated with evidence of pancreatic irritation on his blood work.
He was instructed to continue Protonix daily, taking it shortly before breakfast, and to use Dicyclomine as needed for acute symptoms. He verbalized understanding of the plan to seek consultation with both a vascular surgeon for the aneurysm and a general surgeon for the gallbladder.
Plan:
Protonix 40 mg Take 1 tablet by mouth every morning 30 min before meals
dicyclomine 10 mg Take 1 capsule by mouth three times a day as needed-abdominal pain
Monitor clinical course and call with any problems or worsening symptoms in the interim.
Additional Notes:
E&M Code 99214: This visit warrants a moderate level of medical decision making. The encounter involved the management of multiple problems: gastritis (stable, with medication adjustment), abdominal aortic aneurysm (newly discussed, high risk, requires urgent referral), and cholecystitis (newly discussed, requires referral). The data review was moderate, including discussion of a recent upper endoscopy with biopsy results and a prior CT scan. The risk of morbidity from the patient's conditions is high, particularly the unmanaged aortic aneurysm, which was extensively discussed."

History of Present Illness:
Patient is seen in follow-up regarding chronic abdominal pain, GERD and constipation. She has been taking lubiprostone 24 mcg twice daily but still having ongoing issues with constipation with 1 bowel movement a week. She denies significant nausea, vomiting. She was directly admitted from my office in 5/2025 for worsening constipation and had GoLytely cleanout with some improvement, subsequently was transferred to Methodist for cognitive issues and headaches due to VP shunt issues, which per her were managed conservatively she was admitted to Methodist in August for headaches. She says that she has surgery scheduled to shorten her VP shunt tubing later this month. CT abdomen/pelvis 8/10/2025 with CCK, nonobstructive nephrolithiasis, VP shunt ending in pelvis. She remains a long-winded historian.
5/16/2025 Patient is seen today via telemedicine video visit from office using doxy.me video portal platform. Appropriate informed consent was obtained prior to initiating this visit. This televisit was done at patient's behest as she was complaining of significant constipation for last 2-1/2 weeks. Patient mentions having VP shunt replacement done last week of April as shunt was malfunctioning and causing cognitive issues and headaches. Since surgery she has not been able to have a bowel movement. She has been taking lubiprostone twice daily and has taken enemas as well as milk of magnesia as well without any results. She complains of nausea/vomiting and mild diffuse abdominal pain. She was counseled to head to ER. I spoke to ER physician on phone and apprised them of the situation.

5/16/2023 Patient presents for follow up on abdominal pain and constipation. 02/11/23 Cr 1.04, Hba1c 6.1, TSH, CBC, rest CMP ok. UA with > 30 WBC, many bacteria. Culture with e.coli. 2/13/2023 CT Abdomen and Pelvis w/ Contrast - no acute findings, choledochojejunostomy changes, VP shunt, hysterectomy. She has completed course of antibiotics. She is currently complaining of diffuse abdominal pain which feels sore in nature, which is present constantly on a daily basis for the past 4 days. It is exacerbated after eating/drinking. The pain present in the lower portion of her abdomen feels better after a bowel movement.. She is having mostly daily BMs with amitiza and magnesium. Her stools are intermittently light colored.  Her dysphagia has returned and she feels as if foods, and even her saliva will get stuck in her throat. She does not have trouble with drinking water. She has also been having ongoing acid reflux symptoms mostly at night, almost daily. She is also having foul smelling belches. She is using TUMS and Rolaids as omeprazole is no longer covered by her insurance. She went to Methodist ER April 7th for chest pains, SOB, and abdominal pain. 04/08/23 CTA chest with findings of BL lower lobes small airway disease or small vessel disease. CT head with no acute findings, small pneumocephalus in right frontal horn can be postoperative, right partial approach ventricular stomach catheter with tip in right atrium. Labs with K+ 3.1, Cr 1.3,  rest CMP, BNP, CBC, UA, troponin ok. She has tried to follow up with her neurosurgeon but has been unable to make an appointment.
2/9/23 Patient presents for follow up. She followed up with her neurosurgeon Dr. Pakzaban shortly after her last visit for abdominal pain and abnormal swelling. She was admitted and found to be septic with infected VP shunt. She required repeat surgery and replacement of her VP shunt in a new position. Since then, she has still been struggling with constant, dull lower abdominal pain which will be intermittently sharp. It is aggravated with movement and does have some improvement with bowel movements. She has seen her neurosurgeon again who recommends following up with us. She is having almost daily BMs, which are more loose when she does go. She is on amitiza daily and magnesium intermittently. No current nausea/vomiting. Her dysphagia and acid reflux are well controlled currently with omeprazole.
Patient had a VP shunt placed at Bayshore HCA 1/2023 for hydrocephalus.
03/24/22 Esophageal motility with normal LES relaxation and esophageal peristalsis, one hypercontractile swallow and poor upper esophageal contractility (large break between striated and smooth muscle).
12/14/2021 Patient is seen today via telemedicine video visit from office using doxy.me video portal platform. Appropriate informed consent was obtained prior to initiating this visit. EGD/colonoscopy done 8/28/2020. EGD revealed small hiatal hernia, Hill grade 3 and minimal gastritis; biopsies HP/celiac/EoE -ve. Colonoscopy with few hyperplastic rectosigmoid polyps, difficult procedure due to adhesions/looping. Patient is seen in follow-up after recent EGD with Endoflip and Bravo 11/23/2021. EGD revealed small hiatal hernia, Endoflip with findings of? EGJ outflow obstruction with repetitive retrograde contractions, possible achalasia. Bravo pH study shows presence of significant reflux. Patient continues to have substernal discomfort radiating to her back on swallowing as well as significant heartburn. Her constipation is somewhat improved on Amitiza twice daily. She lost her home in the recent hurricane in Kentucky and emotional distress to it is making her symptoms worse. She feels like she is being eaten up by parasites and wants to get checked for that. She was counseled regarding need to pursue esophageal manometry given Endoflip findings concerning for achalasia; she is highly anxious about the procedure and wants antianxiety medications prior to it. She had seen cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Banki for consideration of hiatal hernia repair but surgeon declined citing high risk given previous surgeries in that area in the past and recommended ongoing PPI therapy.
3/3/20 Patient underwent her final banding today. She says that she is still having constipation issues despite being on Linzess and magnesium pills. Her GERD is controlled on omeprazole daily. She is due for surveillance colonoscopy and is interested in TIF procedure as well which was extensively discussed. Her dysphagia is improved on PPI. Cardiac work-up including echo and stress test was normal.Recent labs which revealed normal CBC, CMP, TSH, cortisol, HbA1c. She has been taking omeprazole daily which has significantly helped her reflux, atypical chest pain/spasms. She had vasovagal syncope after first banding in 2/2019 and did not want to do further banding.Barium esophagram 11/5/2019 revealed 2 to 3 cm hiatal hernia, mild to moderate delay in contrast passage worse with solids and intermittent reflux to lower esophagus. History of one surgery on the neck in September 2019, neurosurgeon was Dr. Paxaben and is currently seeing a neurologist for postconcussion syndrome.She tells me that she had an accident with significant turbulence in Southwest airline in February 2019 when she ended up throwing around in the And injuring her cervical spine. She feels that during subsequent hospitalization, 1 of the physicians pushed too deeply in her epigastric area with a probe and since then she has had dysphagia.
1/29/2018 She tells me that she had complicated GB/bile duct surgery many years ago at BJC in 1996 and ended up having what appears to be a hepaticojejunostomy. She started having PEG pain along with nausea 2 weeks ago and was seen in ER 1 week ago. Labs revealed a normal CBC,CMP and CT was normal except significant constipation and penumobilia s/p CCK. She has severe constipation and will have couple BMs per month. S he has tried multiple OTC laxatives without improvement. She took 2 gallons of golytely for cleanout prior to colonoscopy in 8/2017 by Dr Woods when few polyps were removed and she had a splenic injury as well. She was started on docusate and PPI after recent ER visit which has not helped much. Her abd pain is improved currently. Colonoscopy report from 2017 was reviewed and revealed six 2-6 mm adenoma throughout the colon; she had splenic laceration as a complication of the procedure. She has hisant endometriosis causing adhesions. EGD on 2/13/18 revealed small HH,mild gastritis; biopsies -ve for HP and celiac. MRI was normal except CCK state.tory of signific

History of Present Illness:
Larry Robinson is a 78 year old male who is seen today for a follow-up visit for difficulty swallowing and pressure in his chest. He had an EGD with dilation 3/10/2025 for difficulty swallowing that shows patchy white plaques in entire esophagus suspicious for candidiasis and esophagitis. He had a dilation to 54Fr. He completed the oral Nystatin as scribed and is taking Pantoprazole 40 mg 1 tab daily. He reports that initially his swallowing did improve, but he continues to c/o pressure in his chest with meals. He reports when he eats he will have pressure to his mid chest for anywhere from a few minutes to several hours. He did have a swallow study done in 5/2025 that showed reflux and a few tertiary contractions. He was seen by cardiology this summer and advised that he could discontinue his Eliquis and take ASA. He does use an inhale corticosteroid for his asthma. Advised to make sure he rinses his mouth and throat after use and suggested that he get a spacer to use with his inhaler as well. Will retreat for candida at this time.

rectal bleeding, hemorrhoids, constipation
History of Present Illness:
Joe Mazzola is an 80 year old male patient who is seen today for an initial visit. He went to the ER in July with rectal bleeding. He had a rectal exam and was noted to have internal hemorrhoids that had prolapsed. He denies being diagnosed with a rectal prolapse. The doctor was able to reduce them, but he was advised that he likely needs surgery. He was advised to see a surgeon for his hemorrhoids in 2010 after a colonoscopy that showed Grade III internal hemorrhoids, but he never went. He has been treating them with OTC hemorrhoid creams, and that worked ok until recently.  His hemorrhoids prolapse frequently and bleed. He was having trouble with constipation, which would cause them to flare up. He changed his diet after the ER visit, and is no longer having constipation. He notes that he does not have anyone to take him in for a colonoscopy, which is why he has never had another one. He has been getting a Cologuard from the VA clinic and those were negative. He reports that at his last visit he was told that those were no longer needed secondary to his age. No other recent illness, procedure, or ER visit. Weight is down about 30 pounds since he started the diet, and he is feeling much better with the weight loss, too. He has been more active with the weight loss.

Crohn's
History of Present Illness:
Jacqueline Jordan is an 84 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit for Crohn's disease. She was started on Humira around 8/2024. Her fecal calprotectin was still markedly elevated at 3010 in January, 2025, and was 3500 in 10/2024. Humira levels were checked and were low, so she did weekly injections for a month, then started on every 10 day regimen. Fecal calprotectin in August was 3200, and she is waiting on patient assistance to start Tremfya. She reports that she continues to have diarrhea, worse in the evening, but she does not have the diarrhea every day. She has had some formed stool occasionally.  No bleeding. She has abdominal cramping, but not severe.  She really does not feel that there has been any change in her symptoms since starting on Humira or with increasing the dose, and is just thankful that her symptoms are rather mild. Denies hematochezia or melena. Weight stable. She will use Imodium as needed. She follows with Dr. Patibandla for anemia, has had infusions for this. She is due for Hep B and TB Gold testing.
EGD and colonoscopy on 4/24/24 for investigation of iron deficiency anemia. EGD findings were a benign-appearing esophageal stenosis and mild Schatzki ring, dilated with mild resistance at 48 fr, and a 3 cm hiatal hernia. Biopsies of the duodenum were negative for celiac disease. Colonoscopy findings were internal and external hemorrhoids and diverticulosis. Capsule endoscopy was done 5/30/24. Capsule did not leave the small intestine during the recording time. Aphthous ulcers and erosions were noted in the proximal small intestine, multiple circumferential ulcers and mild strictures noted in the mid and distal small intestine, concerning for Crohn's disease. Prometheus IBD test was negative.

History of Present Illness:
David Townsley is a 71 year old male who is seen today for a follow-up visit for diarrhea, black stools, and weight loss. He reports that he started having diarrhea in the last 10 days. He reports that he was having upwards of 10+ loose BMs daily. He  has had some black stools, but does report that he took some pepto. Occult stool negative x 3 on 9/9/2025. Denies that he has abdominal pain, but that he will just have the feeling that he needs to have a BM.  When he does go his stool is loose and has excessive mucus. Has noted about a 30# weight loss in the last 6 months. This has occurred gradually and he did not even really realize he had lost the weight. Labs done recently showed that he is moderately anemic with elevated LFTs. His calcium and magnesium were also low. His PCP advised that he discontinue his pantoprazole and add magnesium and calcium supplement. He was also advised to start taking an iron supplement. He added this in the last few days. He reports since discontinuing his pantoprazole he has significant reflux most of the time. He denies any hx of anemia or liver disease. He does report a hx of chronic kidney disease that was stage 4, but has improved over the last few years. No family hx of colon cancer or polyps. No family hx of pancreatic cancer. He does drink alcohol several days a week. He had an essentially normal colonoscopy in 12/2022. No prior EGD. He reports a hx of a bowel obstruction in the past due to a ""fat pad"" (?) that required surgery with removal of a portion of small bowel.

GERD
History of Present Illness:
Cheryl Bell is a 70 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit for GERD. Recently she had a flare up of severe chest pain (cardiac work up was negative) and reflux. PCP gave one month script for Voquenza 10 mg and this worked to improve symptoms, now she is back on pantoprazole 40 mg once a day. She has dysphagia with solids, liquids and pills. Gets hung up. Last EGD was in 2022. When she had this ""flare up"" she was also seeing black ""dots"" in her stools. She states it looked like coffee ground. This has cleared up since GERD resolved. Bowel movements are normal. No bloody stools, nausea, vomiting or fever. Appetite is good. She's taking aspirin 81 mg and baclofen 10 mg. Of note, she had a cholecystectomy was in 2005. When she eats, fried foods or salads, she has RUQ abdominal pain. She notes that when she eats gluten free foods, she does well and feels better. Her recent LFTs were unremarkable- AST 16, ALT 13, total billi 0.5, ALKP 96. She has a history of fatty liver, diagnosed 20 years ago. No recent abdominal imaging. She does not see a hepatologist. Denies drinking alcohol and smoking. She drinks about 3 cups of coffee daily and this also triggers the RUQ abdominal pain.

History of Present Illness:
Claudia Bruda is a 53 year old female patient who is seen today for an initial visit.Verbal consent obtained from the patient to utilize the AutoScribe application during the visit.  She was last seen in 2022.
She is here with her daughter Kayla.
Claudia is a 53 year old female who presents for evaluation of worsening gastroesophageal reflux symptoms, which began approximately one month ago. She describes a burning sensation in her chest. About a week ago, she experienced an episode of acid regurgitation into her throat while attempting to burp, which resulted in aspiration and a coughing spell. She does not recall her food intake prior to that event.
Claudia reports a history of reflux issues, but states her symptoms were well-controlled prior to this recent exacerbation. She attributes the change to increased stress at work and anxiety. She has also experienced unintentional weight loss, from 153 lbs down to 138 lbs, which she also attributes to stress. Her sleep has been disrupted; she goes to bed around midnight and wakes at 6:30 or 7:00 AM, but is also waking up at 2:00 or 3:00 AM to pick up her 19-year-old son from his overnight job. She expresses significant worry about her son's safety, which contributes to her stress and difficulty sleeping. Her diet has been irregular due to her work schedule. She sometimes eats late at night, around 9:00 PM, often driven by anxiety rather than hunger.
She initially tried over-the-counter omeprazole (Prilosec), which she felt worsened her symptoms, describing increased acid burping. She then switched to lansoprazole and then famotidine (Zantac), taking two pills about 30 minutes before meals as needed. This provides some relief, but she still experiences breakthrough symptoms, particularly when lying down after eating. On those occasions, she has used baking soda with water for relief. She also reports that drinking water in the morning can cause her to burp up water. She has noted a change in her bowel habits recently, experiencing a feeling of incomplete evacuation and increased constipation, for which she uses a suppository approximately four times per week. She reports this started recently and may be related to antacid use. She experiences bloating after eating flour-based products. She denies nausea or dysphagia.
Claudia is seeing a hand specialist for a trigger finger on her hand, which became swollen at work from lifting heavy boxes. She has a follow-up appointment with her PCP, Dr. Philips, tomorrow to review blood work, including thyroid function.

05/14/2025:
Patient presents for follow-up of Crohn's disease and associated complications. She reports ongoing issues with a persistent fistula tract in the vaginal wall, which has been present since before her colectomy. The fistula causes intermittent drainage of mucus and other fluids, varying in color from clear to yellow to green. She denies any fecal matter coming through the fistula.
The patient has been taking dicyclomine 10mg twice daily, which she reports has significantly reduced the leakage from the fistula. She experimented with increasing the dosage to three times daily for a week and noticed further improvement. She is hopeful that reducing drainage might allow the fistula to heal.
The patient has undergone multiple surgeries (6 in total) since 2020 to address the fistula, but it has not fully resolved. She is currently under the care of a new doctor who has proposed a treatment plan, but surgery cannot be scheduled until June due to her work schedule.
Regarding her Crohn's disease management, the patient reports being off Humira for the past two months due to insurance and pharmacy issues. She expresses concern about trying the biosimilar, as previous attempts with Entyvio and Stelara were unsuccessful, leading to complications and ultimately surgery.
The patient also mentions ongoing issues with low magnesium and intermittently low potassium levels, which are being managed with regular infusions and supplements. Her anemia has been stable, with hemoglobin levels around 14 g/dL for most of the school year, though it has dropped to 11 g/dL in the past two months, which she attributes to stress following her father's death in March.
She continues to take esomeprazole daily for acid reflux, which she reports is helpful.
___update 09/10/2025:
The patient returns for follow-up of Crohn's disease s/p colectomy with ostomy bag. She reports significant concerns regarding her current biologic therapy, having been switched from Humira to a biosimilar (adalimumab-adaz) in May 2025 due to insurance requirements. Since starting the biosimilar in May, she has experienced new onset hypertension beginning in June, with blood pressure readings as high as 178/160 mmHg, compared to her baseline of 118/78-80 mmHg. She has been monitoring her blood pressure at home for the past month, noting that it is elevated more often than not, particularly when she experiences headaches.
Additionally, she reports nausea lasting 1-2 days following each injection, which causes her to skip breakfast as the thought of eating is unappealing. While she finds this side effect manageable, the persistent hypertension is concerning to her. She took her last biosimilar injection on Sunday.
The patient also reports some recent lower abdominal discomfort that occurred just before her next scheduled injection, though this resolved after taking the injection. She notes uncertainty about the source of this pain given her extensive surgical history and altered anatomy.
Regarding her Crohn's disease management, she continues to have concerns about medication absorption due to her short bowel. She does get magnesium IV infusions.  Her GI symptoms appear otherwise stable aside from the injection-related nausea.
She continues on esomeprazole daily for acid reflux with good symptom control and dicyclomine three times daily, occasionally increasing to four times daily when experiencing increased discomfort around injection time.
She sees hematologist Dr. Asim Ahmed gets routine labs with him  for IDA

Assessment:
We discussed the pathophysiology and natural history of anal fissures. We discussed that it often times takes weeks and sometimes even months for an anal fissure to resolve, but if symptoms worsen despite the usage of medicated ointments & conservative measures then may need a colorectal surgery consultation. We also discussed the importance of addressing and improving underlying constipation symptoms. We discussed avoiding straining with bowel movements, manipulation of the anus, aggressive wiping or cleaning, and we discussed limiting the use of soaps around the anus for now until evidence of healing. Will provide Rx. for compounded cream containing Nifedipine and Lidocaine along with adjunct therapies for 8 weeks to facilitate healing. If healing does not occur then will need to consider colorectal surgery referral.
We discussed the pathophysiology and natural history of hemorrhoids. I explained that hemorrhoids are symptomatic anal cushions which are a part of normal anatomy and we differentiate internal and external hemorrhoids based on location in the anal canal. We discussed the importance of avoiding straining and constipation via maintaining adequate hydration with at least 6-8 glasses of water per day, bowel regimen as needed with MiraLax 1-3x/day, and increase dietary fiber (25-35g/day) with supplements such as Citrucel/Metamucil (but caution on potential for increased gas and/or bloating). Increase exercise as tolerated. If patient continues having pruritus, pain, discomfort, or burning, I recommended a trial of warm sitz baths 20min 2x/day for 2 weeks and advised the use of wet wipes rather than toilet paper. If patient continues to have persistent bleeding despite medical treatment, will consider hemorrhoid ligation or referral to colorectal surgery to discuss surgical options.
Plan:	Lose weight with diet/exercise as discussed. Attempt 10% body weight loss over 6 months.*
Gradual titration of fiber supplementation discussed (Benefiber, psyllium (Metamucil) or Citrucel - 1-2 heaped tablespoons daily with fluids.
Miralax titration recommended

History of Present Illness:
4-2-24:- 55-year-old croatian female who has previously seen Dr. Masand and then was seen by me in 2018. She has a history of chronic abdominal pain and bloating. She had a cholecystectomy in 2016. She had an ultrasound in 2016 prior to cholecystectomy which showed gallstones but was otherwise normal except for a liver hemangioma. She had a CT of the abdomen and pelvis in March 2017 which showed no acute findings except for uterine fibroids and ovarian cysts. She does have a 2.3 x 2.7 cm right liver lobe hemangioma. She has been treated with PPI and Atrantil in the past with improvement. She was last seen in 2019. That is no family history of colon cancer or polyps or stomach cancer. No IBD. She had EGD in the past that showed some gastritis. Colonoscopy November 2018 showed 2 colon polyps, one tubulovillous adenoma and a sessile serrated adenoma, advise a repeat exam in 2 years which she is overdue for. Recent gynecologic records from Dr. Brenda Axxman reviewed. She saw them March 2024. She was complaining of increased vaginal odor after intercourse. She is on hormone replacement with an estrogen patch as well as Mirena IUD. She was diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis and treated with Flagyl 500 mg twice a day for 7 days
7/2/25
Patient presents here today to report of ongoing lower abdominal pain. Patient states that this pain is similar to the pain that she had last year. she has had this pain for the last few months, but it has worsened over the last few weeks. She has nausea when she gets the lower abdominal pain and her appetite has decreased due to the pain. She describes this pain as a dull ache. She is taking dicyclomine every 8 hours as needed which helps a little. Had labs few weeks with PCP which were normal per patient. we do not have those results. She saw her primary care physician yesterday, and she was started on empiric antibiotics with Ciprofloxacin and flagyl. Patient said that she recently saw her GYN and had a pelvic ultrasound which was normal per patient. She also reports that her pap smear was normal. She had a CT abdomen 4/2024 which was normal. She also underwent colonoscopy 5/2024 and path showed benign polypoid tissue. She denies any upper abdominal pain or dysphagia.
She reports that her bowel movements are normal. She denies any blood in the stool. Few weeks ago, she was found to have urinary tract infection and was treated with antibiotics. She reports that her UTI symptoms have resolved. Her primary care physician referred her to see a urologist. She underwent Cystoscopy on June 9th 2025 and was found to have a 0.5-centimeter mass in the bladder. She received mitomycin c instillation. Path showed papillary urothelial carcinoma.
7-8-25:
- The patient is seen today in a follow-up visit. She has been experiencing continued abdominal pain and had an emergency room visit at Texas Health Resources on July 7th. During the ER visit, she underwent several tests, including a normal EKG, CBC, CMP, urinalysis, and a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast. The CT scan was notable for a right hepatic hemangioma and an absent gallbladder, but otherwise showed no acute findings. Prior to this visit, a CT angiogram had been planned to rule out any vascular etiology for her pain. She was discharged from the ER with prescriptions for tramadol, dicyclomine, and Zofran. A Helicobacter pylori breath test was also ordered at a previous visit. The patient reports noticing dark stools and describes the stool as being in pieces. She has had a recent colonoscopy, which was normal, but has not had an upper endoscopy yet. She is considering this due to the possibility of an ulcer or other gastrointestinal source of her pain. She also mentions cloudy urine, but her urologist has cleared her and advised follow-up in four months. The patient has stopped taking probiotics but noted some improvement when she was on them.
- Helicobacter pylori breath test: Ordered, results pending.
9-9-25:
- 57-year-old woman who presents with ongoing abdominal pain. She previously underwent an EGD on July 10, 2025, which showed Grade B reflux esophagitis without Barrett's esophagus. Multiple small gastric polyps were biopsied and identified as benign fundic gland polyps. Biopsies from the stomach and duodenum were otherwise negative. Treatment was initiated with pantoprazole 40 mg daily and sucralfate 1 gram BID. A repeat endoscopy was advised in 3 months, which she is now due for. Additionally, a CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast, ordered by Dr. Shane Zatkalik on August 18, 2025, was normal with no acute findings. The patient mentions not consistently taking the second dose of sucralfate but is still on pantoprazole once daily. She also reports visiting a pain specialist, Dr. Ali, who conducted an MRI of her spine, which came back normal. The patient was referred to see another doc due to potential autoimmune concerns. She has recently submitted a stool test sample for further evaluation of her symptoms. She has been prescribed dicyclomine for stomach pain but has not been using it consistently due to the overwhelming number of medications. She is currently using Tramadol once daily but is attempting to decrease her reliance on medications.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. Lunsford is a 69-year-old male with a past medical history of GERD, remote Nissen fundoplication, colon polyps, DM, HLD, HTN, and obesity who presents for evaluation of hemorrhoids. He was last seen in office in February 2025 with symptoms of reflux exacerbation.
He reports the onset of a painful, swollen lump in the anal area approximately two weeks ago, associated with intermittent scant hematochezia noted on wiping. He denies any recent change in bowel habits such as constipation or straining and has no prior history of hemorrhoids. He denies associated abdominal pain or fevers. He was evaluated by his primary care physician one and a half weeks ago and was prescribed a hydrocortisone and pramoxine cream and advised to use sitz baths. He reports the lump has become smaller and much less painful since onset.
His reflux symptoms, which were exacerbated in February 2025, are now well-controlled. He has successfully reduced his Nexium from 40 mg twice daily back to once daily without recurrence of significant symptoms.
