Assessment:
1. UC: The pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of this disorder was reviewed in detail. The chronic relapsing nature of his disease, need for maintenance therapy, as well as the importance of compliance with medical therapy was also discussed. Distinction between a ""step-up"" approach and a ""step-down"" or 'proactive' strategy with a permanent model was also outlined. We discussed the risk factors for severe disease phenotypes which increase the risk of future surgery and complications. We discussed the elevated long-term risk of colon cancer and need for future surveillance colonoscopies to evaluate for dysplasia. I discussed the treatment options in detail including risks, benefits, and alternatives. Patient was started on mesalamine and mesalamine suppositories following her colonoscopy and called into the clinic with worsening symptoms for which she was started on prednisone 40 mg p.o. daily. On her previous visit we discussed dose escalation and she agreed upon medication of Entyvio which she started on 12/2023. She has now received 2 infusions with clinical improvement and is now established on every 2 weeks subcutaneous injection. Repeat fecal calprotectin on 4/2024 revealed significantly elevated levels. GI PCR was negative despite history of C. difficile and recent antibiotic usage. CSP was performed on 6/2024 with evidence of chronic active colitis in the distal colon with ulceration. Entyvio levels obtained with no Abs and therapeutic levels. Patient was deemed a secondary non-responder to Entyvio. We discussed the potential therapeutic changes and decieded to proceed with Skyrizi. She was induced on 8/2024 and appears to be doing well clinically. Fecal calp in 6/2025 was 41. CSP in 6/2025 was normal. She is feeling well and states that she is able to go out to events without concerns for having UC flare. Will have her continue Skyrizi q8 weeks. Will order fecal calp today.
2. Change in bowel habits: The patient reports a chronic history of constipation likely a consequence of opiate pain medications and previously treated with Movantik. On her initial visit with me on 5/2022, she was having irregular bowel movements with occasional diarrhea, constipation, and fecal incontinence. Colonoscopy performed on 3/2022 revealing cecal inflammation with pathology revealing acute active colitis. I recommended fiber supplementation and stool studies revealing C. difficile infection as well as abnormally high fecal calprotectin level. Patient underwent treatment for C. difficile but continues to have irregular bowel habits with mucoid stools and intermittent rectal bleeding. She had a recent visit to the emergency room with symptoms suggestive of acute gastroenteritis. Fecal calprotectin obtained with elevation prompting repeat colonoscopy performed with evidence of ulcerative colitis. We discussed there is still a potential for overlap of IBS-D and inflammatory bowel disease along with opioid-induced adverse effect. We will continue monitoring.
3. C. diff Colitis: The patient underwent a colonoscopy in 3/2022 with cecal biopsy showing acute colitis. We discussed the potential for NSAID induced colitis which he is currently take daily. GI PCR subsequently returned positive treated twice now with Vanc. x 14 days and again with vancomycin taper. Repeat C. difficile PCR positive 12/2022 for which she is pending approval for Dificid through the pharmaceutical company. Of note, E. coli was also positive for which she received treatment with ciprofloxacin. Repeat C. difficile PCR and cytotoxin cell assay was negative from June, 2023. Repeat GI PCR and C Diff PCR 5/2024 was negative.
4. GERD: The patient has typical reflux symptoms well controlled on omeprazole. Recent endoscopy on 3/2022 revealing a 4 cm sliding hiatal hernia with no significant esophagitis. We will continue current therapy; however, in the setting of recurrent C. difficile may need to consider anti-reflux surgery given association between PPI and enteric infections. She is doing well on Omeprazole 40mg once daily. will continue current regimen.
5. Abdominal pain: Patient reports right lower quadrant burning abdominal pain which has been ongoing. She reports pain despite taking prednisone and mesalamine which makes me suspect a noninflammatory etiology. She does have a history of chronic lower back pain and intervention which may be resulting in radiculopathy.
6. Perianal irritation: Patient reports perianal irritation with nodular folliculitis with occasional drainage. There is a possibility of a deep-seated abscess as well. She was given a trial of Bactrim and vancomycin prophylactically previously with improvement. No active complaints.

History of Present Illness:
Very pleasant 32-year-old female here today for consultation regarding abnormal LFTs. She was in her normal state of health until recently blood work showed elevated LFTs with an AST and ALT around 40-60. Previously they have been normal. She has been on Mounjaro for diabetes and weight loss for the last 2 to 3 years and has lost about 80 pounds. After the blood work showed the abnormal LFTs she had a FibroScan which showed CAP of 207 but an kPa of 11 with a low IQR. She has no prior known history of liver disease. She also is currently being worked up for Graves' disease and has a pending appointment with endocrinology next month.

Patient is a 71-year-old M referred by Dr. Williams who presents as a follow-up for GERD. Patient was seen by Dr. Chumley in 2019. Patient was seen on 3/2022 with worsening reflux symptoms while sleeping and after meals. He was taking Pantoprazole and Mylanta. On his visit on 5/2022 he started taking Nexium OTC with improvement. On his visit on 9/2022 he was doing well on OTC Nexium. On his visit on 3/2023 he was doing well on Rabeprazole 20mg PO daily. He reported two weeks prior he underwent surgery for tongue cancer s/p excision. On his visit on 4/2024 he was doing well on Rabeprazole 20mg PO daily. He reported some worsening constipation. He did change his diet given that he was pre-DM. On his visit on 6/2024 he reported increased bloating and burping with persistent constipation. On his visit on 11/2024 he continued to have dyspepsia and gas. He was given Flagyl for possible SIBO. On his visit on 2/2025 he began having daily BMs with soft stool consistency. He was taking fiber supplements and Miralax. He remained on Rabeprazole with good control of reflux. He was seen on 6/24/2025 and reported persistent bowel irregularity despite taking fiber supplements. He did start Lubiprostone and remains on Rabeprazole for reflux. He was seen on 7/29/2025 and reported experiencing lower abdominal cramping and pain last Tuesday/Wednesday, and on Friday he was on the verge of going to the ER/UC. Saturday morning, his pain subsided but he still felt tender. He took Dulcolax 4 tabs on Sunday with diarrhea which gave him relief. He was given Lubiprostone 8mcg twice daily, Citrucel 1tbsp once daily, Miralax 1capful once daily and he was doing well initially having a BM every 1-2 days. Gradually it got more prolonged. He was started on Linzess and reported diarrhea with urgency. He states that he faithfully took it for 2 weeks but 2 hours after taking the medication, he would have 4-5 bouts of diarrhea with urgency. He was seen on 8/20/2025 and reported taking Miralax 1 capful once daily, Citrucel tablets 2-3 times a day and IBGard 3 times daily and is having a bowel movement almost every day, although it is small amounts and stated it is very ""unsatisfying."" He is experiencing milder abdominal pain, bloating and incomplete emptying.
Currently, he reports last weekend he started having lower abdominal cramping and bloating and was very constipated. His symptoms persisted until Monday morning and he increased the Linzess to 145mcg which relieved his bowel movement and abdominal cramps. He is also taking IBGard 3 times a day.

Diagnosis:
GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease)
Family history of colon cancer in father
Chronic idiopathic constipation
Abdominal cramping
Assessment:
1. GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) - The patient has a chronic history of GERD well-controlled with medications and lifestyle restrictions. We discussed the pathophysiology and natural history of reflux. He reports worsening symptoms typical of GERD recently with the addition of Mylanta and Protonix with worsening insomnia. He was previously on Nexium with relief, but was concerned about potential adverse effects. We discussed the potential long-term adverse effects of PPI therapy and I provided him with reassurance. He does not have alarm symptoms at this stage that warrants endoscopic evaluation. Although the patient is well controlled on Nexium his insurance approves Rabeprazole 20 mg p.o. daily which he has been doing with improved symptoms. We will plan to continue this therapy.
2. Family history of colon cancer in father - DX 70s/Personal history of colon polyps: The patient's last CSP was on 5/2018. CSP performed 6/2023 with multiple TAs and HPs. Recall in 3 yrs, 6/2026.
3. IBS-Constipation: DDx. includes medication induced v. chronic idiopathic constipation v. IBS-C v. slow transit constipation v. pelvic floor dysfunction v. metabolic derangements v. lack on fluid/fiber intake etc. We discussed the pathophysiology and natural history of the various causes of constipation. Further diagnostic testing includes laboratory testing, imaging, and endoscopic evaluation. We discussed the various symptoms of constipation including infrequency, excessive straining, incomplete emptying, hard stools, bloating, use of digital evacuation etc. Increase exercise as tolerated. I advised to maintain adequate hydration with at least 64 oz/day with exercise as tolerated. Stop lubiprostone, and will send in Linzess. I advised him to continue with Citrucel and Miralax and to titrate up to 3x a day. He had an episode of lower abdominal cramping last week and did not have a BM all week until he took Dulcolax on Sunday and had bowel movements. Trialed Linzess 145mcg once daily for 2 weeks with diarrhea 4x/day with urgency. He stopped taking it and started citrucel 2 tabs TID, miralax 1 capful once daily, and IB Gard TID with sensation of incomplete emptying and small BMs. We discussed lowering dose to 72 mcg once daily with IBGard and Citrucel only 2 tabs once daily. If he continues to have diarrhea with urgency can titrate down to every other day. I also advised him to add Miralax as needed. He had an episode of constipation this last weekend and increased his Linzess to 145mcg once daily on Monday with relief of his symptoms. We discussed increasing Linzess to 145mcg and he agrees.
4. Lower abdominal cramping: DDx. includes colonic spasms v. constipation v. diverticulitis v. appendicitis v. colitis v. IBD v. adhesions v. obstruction v. abdominal wall pain v. functional abdominal pain v. radiculopathy v. genitourinary/gynecological causes etc. We discussed the potential causes of the patient’s symptoms and the diagnostic work-up which includes imaging and endoscopic evaluation. Recent CT AP demonstrated acute sigmoid diverticulitis, and he was treated with a course of Augmentin. He reports pain resolved. Last CSP was in 2023 and he is due for another next year.
Plan:
Gradual titration of fiber supplementation discussed (Benefiber, Metamucil, Citrucel.)
Miralax titration recommended
Drink at least 64oz of water daily
Renew and Increase Linzess 72 mcg to 145 mcg Take 1 capsule mouth, on an empty stomach, at least 30 minutes before a meal, ~same time each day
Renew rabeprazole 20 mg TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH EVERY DAY
Renew IBgard 90 mg Take 1-2 capsules by mouth three times a day as needed for abdominal pain
Follow-up with P.A./N.P. in 3 months

Yearly follow up, phlegm
History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 49-year-old gentleman who was initially seen by Dr. Garza in February 2023 for an opinion regarding colon cancer screening. He underwent EGD colonoscopy in February 2023 which showed gastric previous surgery, internal hemorrhoids, otherwise normal. Nissen appeared to be partially done. If patient desires can consider surgical evaluation. Repeat colonoscopy recommended after 10 years. He has now transitioned his care to Dr. Guirl.
Patient presents today for follow-up visit. He had been feeling well up until 3 months ago when he started to develop increased phlegm, throat clearning and hoarseness of voice. He does report occasional heartburn and reflux. He is currently not taking anything for his symptoms. He is asking if his Nissen fundoplication should be redone. This was completed 20 years ago when he thinks it was done with Dr. Woodard. He also reports intermittent rectal pain and sometimes constipation with straining. He is currently not using anything over-the-counter for his symptoms and has not tried a high-fiber diet. He otherwise denies any issues with dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, gas or bloating, changes in bowel habits, blood in his stool, melena, unintentional weight loss or fevers.

Assessment:
The natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of GERD was reviewed with the patient. Lifestyle and dietary modifications were also recommended, including weight loss, elevating head of the bed, avoiding meals 2 to 3 hours prior to bedtime, avoidance of tobacco products, and avoidance of ""trigger foods"". Will give him a trial of pantoprazole 40 mg daily 30 to 60 minutes prior to breakfast to see if this helps with the symptoms. He will follow-up with me in 3 months and we will see how he is doing at that time. If symptoms persist, can consider referral to ENT.
Patient would also like recommendations to see if his Nissen fundoplication needs to be redone. He thinks this was completed by Dr. Woodard 20 years ago. We will refer him to Dr. Woodard for further evaluation.
On rectal exam as well as anoscopy, the patient has internal hemorrhoids seen. His exam is otherwise unremarkable. The natural history, pathophysiology and treatment of hemorrhoids was reviewed with the patient. Patient was encouraged to use topical therapy such as Preparation H suppositories as needed. I have also prescribed Anusol suppositories. If his symptoms continue, hemorrhoid banding might be reasonable. He was given information on hemorrhoids and hemorrhoid banding. High fiber diet was recommended to prevent constipation and straining.
Plan:
Refer to Dr. Russell L. Woodard

constipation
History of Present Illness:
Ms. Boseman is a 73 year old patient who presents for a follow up evaluation.
Last Visit 3/14/2025: Since starting the alternating antibiotics for SIBO, symptoms have significantly improved overall. Still experiences recurrence of some symptoms on the week off antibiotics (having frequent small BMs throughout the morning, often waking her up in the early morning, 4am, ranging from Bristol 1-4. Also has a recurrence of bothersome bloating, belching, lower abdominal pressure, and nausea and sometimes vomiting.) This leads to decreased PO intake during that week, and she has continued with unintentional weight loss.
Asymptomatic on the antibiotics, able to eat well those weeks.
Today,
- Has been off alternating antibiotics for some time, but really did have significant improvement in her symptoms after this extended SIBO treatment.
-- Able to eat her own home-grown lettuce, tomatoes, etc, again. Very pleased with her response to this treatment.
- Past 2-3 weeks, back to her baseline of constipation, passing only a small amount of Bristol 1 stools daily.
-- Currently using a stool softener daily (without laxative).
-- When she hasn't been emptying fully, notices recurrence of burping and dyspepsia symptoms.
-- After a trial of stool softener/laxative combination medication, leading to her having a very good BM, finally feeling she had evacuated fully (after a few hours in the bathroom), dyspepsia/burping symptoms resolved.
- Has tried/failed Miralax, MOM, Mg citrate. Senna - works initially, leads to cramping after 3 days of consecutive use.
- Has not tried a prescription laxative in the past.
- Still using Zenpep daily, feels it works well for her.
- Also, Metoclopramide 5 mg, two tablets twice a day with meals. Feels this prevents more significant dyspepsia, bloating, burping symptoms.
- If not constipated, no dyspepsia, nausea, bloating, or abdominal pain.
- Denies blood in the stool, melena, abnormal weight loss.
- Notes, she has been diagnosed with an aggressive vulvular cancer, s/p surgical resection Aug 14th.
-- Chose to do a new study, for a DNA testing for the cancer. If it is positive, she will undergo radiation.

-Patient was found to have elevated LFTs and subsequent ultrasound of the abdomen performed on August 6, 2024 revealing mild enlargement of the liver with imaging findings suggesting chronic liver disease. No focal mass or biliary ductal dilation was seen. Lab work from 7/29/2024 revealing elevated alk phos 172, ALT 58. Normal AST 24, total bilirubin 0.6. Lab work from 7/4/2025 did reveal elevated ALT level of 78, alk phos 209, normal AST and total bilirubin.
-Patient otherwise denies taking any herbal supplements, weight loss supplements, liver clinic supplements or protein supplements. She does report significant family history of liver disease in her mother and maternal grandmother, cirrhosis of the liver. She denies any binge or heavy consumption of alcohol currently or previously.
-She also complains of constipation with bowel movement every other day with sense of incomplete evacuation and does not take any fiber supplementation or laxative.
Recommendation:
The patient labs are elevated in a mixed pattern, ALT and alk phos pre-dominant with intact synthetic function. We discussed at length the differential diagnosis for elevated liver enzymes and the importance of differentiating abnormal liver enzymes from abnormal liver function. like medications v. alcohol v. NAFLD v. autoimmune hepatitis v. PBC v. PSC v. Wilson disease v. hemochromatosis v. alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency v. viral hepatitis etc.
I would like for the patient to obtain AMA to evaluate for autoimmune pathology/PBC and also fractionation of alkaline phosphatase although I suspect this is more fatty liver disease related and at the same time also obtain a hepatic function panel before my follow-up in 6 months. I suspect hepatomegaly is more likely driven by underlying obesity. We will obtain an abdominal x-ray to evaluate for stool burden, based on which we can consider initiating a bowel regimen with fiber and laxatives.
Plan:
Follow-up office visit in 6 months
Alkaline Phosphatase Isoenzyme
Abdomen X-ray 1 view (KUB) - 74018
Mitochondrial Antibody (AMA)
Liver Function Panel (HFP)

abdominal pain
constipation
History of Present Illness:
Patient is a very pleasant 55-year-old Hispanic male who presents today for initial consultation.
The patient has a past medical history of hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and irritable bowel syndrome. He underwent an internal hernia repair in 2016 at Medical City Dallas, which was done on an emergency basis. It sounds like he may have had compromised bowel or bowel obstruction. Of note, he has a large laparotomy scar in his midline.
The patient reports intermittent issues with left-sided gassiness, abdominal pain, and constipation. He can go two to three days without a bowel movement. He actually presented to the Baylor Scott & White McKinney ER for his symptoms in June. A CT scan revealed no acute abdominal process, and labs were unremarkable.
He is here today for follow-up. He still reports intermittent left-sided abdominal pain and constipation, however, not as severe as when he presented to the hospital several months ago. His last EGD and colonoscopy were performed in 1998 in Boston, Massachusetts. He cannot recall any specific findings on those procedures.
Family history is notable for a mother with stomach cancer.
I have reviewed his pertinent labs and imaging studies. The differential diagnosis includes intra-abdominal adhesions, neoplasia, stricturing disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and functional GI disease.
I will schedule him for an EGD and a colonoscopy to investigate his upper abdominal discomfort as well as for colon cancer screening. Furthermore, I will provide him with two weeks of Linzess samples to see if that helps with his symptomatology. I will try to log in to the HCA system to see if I can review his surgery that was performed in 2016.
The patient agrees with the plan as outlined.

Abdominal pain
History of Present Illness:
Jaylen is a very pleasant 31-year-old male with a BMI of 29 that appears in excellent health and presents to the office today from his primary care doctor at the VA Medical Center Dr. Dar with abdominal pain. He began having symptoms around May 2025 for unclear reasons although he did undergo hip surgery a month prior. He did receive prophylactic antibiotics prior to the procedure but did not require them thereafter. He will develop episodes of severe epigastric abdominal pain that would range between 5 or 6 out of 10 to as high as 8 out of 10, sometimes so severe that it would awaken him at night. He describes no triggers, no predictable onset however symptoms do occur randomly and are not alleviated by any typical measures. He did however state there was some improvement at least in the degree of discomfort he was experiencing when he was prescribed 20 mg of omeprazole for 14 days. He was seen and evaluated at the VA Medical Center/emergency department for which she was told the labs and imaging were unremarkable. He denies any solid or liquid dysphagia, no weight changes, no melena or hematochezia. He relates no known history in his family of gastrointestinal malignancies

Assessment:
31-year-old healthy male with a BMI of 29 with several months of epigastric abdominal pain and bloating with a history of reflux intermittently. Etiology remains unclear however his symptoms can be significant, no overt triggers but they do awaken him at night. This is concerning for potentially ulcer disease versus functional etiology or changes related to SIBO from his antibiotics used for surgery in April. All of this was discussed with him today, I recommend a low gas healthy diet at this time, I have recommended starting pantoprazole 40 mg daily empirically and proceeding with endoscopy to evaluate for ulcer disease. I recommend evaluation for SIBO also
Plan:
Lose weight with diet/exercise as discussed. Attempt 10% body weight loss over 6 months.*
Diet as tolerated
pantoprazole 40 mg Take 1 tablet by mouth once a day 30 min before breakfast
My office will obtain prior records from hospital
Adhere to lifestyle and dietary modifications for GERD diet as we discussed. This includes avoiding fatty and greasy foods, fried foods, tomato based foods, caffeine, carbonated drinks, coffee and alcohol. Elevate the head of your bed 6 inches. Additionally, do not eat or drink anything including water within two hours of going to bed at night or 10pm, whichever comes first. Recommend low fat, low cholesterol diet and exercise.
Avoid NSAIDs (Motrin, Advil, ibuprofen, Aleve, Naproxen, etc.)

Iron deficiency anemia
History of Present Illness:
Ms. Katherine Phillips is a very pleasant 43 yo WF seen at the request of CNM Kathleen Donaldson for iron-deficiency anemia.  Labs sent over reviewed:
(8/4/25) - Hgb 10.4 (normal MCV); CBC otherwise fine; CMP normal; normal thyroid function testing and A1c; B12 normal.
Ms. Phillips showed me additional labs in her notebook of prior results:
(8/5/2025) - Iron 28, ferritin 4.37, transferrin saturation 5 all low; elevated TIBC at 548.
For comparison to prior labs, Hgb/ Hct were normal on 6/20/2022, 2/12/2018, and 9/20/2017.
Work-up initiated after she felt lightheaded while on vacation with her father at the Biltmore in Asheville (walking the gardens).  Pre-syncopal and/ or orthostatic symptoms.  EMS assessment negative and she declined the ambulance ride to the hospital.  Persistent orthostatic symptoms since that time (even when sitting).  Denies chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, palpitations.
No overt GI bleeding, change in bowel habits/ stool caliber, unintentional weight loss.  UGI ROS negative except for vague nausea that developed at the same time of the orthostatic symptoms.  It has persisted but does not prevent him from eating.  No family h/o GI malignancies.
No prior EGD or colonoscopy.  No regular NSAID use.  She did show me a result panel from stool diagnostic testing done in 8/2021 - positive for various things including H. pylori.  She never did anything about it in regards to treatment.
Finally when questioned about menstrual periods, the patient does have menometrorrhagia present over the past 3 years.  She can bleed for 3+ weeks straight at a time.  Pelvic ultrasound just completed - she is awaiting a call about results.  Mrs. Phillips also reports receiving the 1st of two doses of IV iron (Venofer).

1. Iron-deficiency anemia - Menometrorrhagia favored to be the most likely explanation based off the history provided.  GI tract evaluation will be completed as requested to be sure no other concurrent pathology (specifically a malignancy or peptic ulcer disease).
- EGD/ colonoscopy.  Plan for biopsies to rule out H. pylori and celiac sprue.  No need to treat the stool test that was positive for H. pylori a few years ago.
2. Nausea - Vague symptom that does not necessarily indicate UGI tract pathology.
3. Menometrorrhagia - Management as per CNM Donaldson.  Patient is not sure if she has been referred to Gynecology yet.
4. Orthostatic dizziness - It should improve after iron studies improve.

Assessment:
Patient reports history of chronic hepatitis B, inactive and has been followed by Dr. Glombicki but not in last couple of years. His PCP's note indicated that he has CHB since 2016.  We do not have HBV labs for review. He had HCV Ab negative from his PCP 3/24.
History of Hepatitis B infection, chronic. HB E Ag = positive / negative / pending. HBV DNA = pending / IU/mL. Discussed mode of transmission, complications and natural history of the disease. Patient with chronic HBV can be infected with hepatitis Delta (HDV) commonly via sexual contacts or drug use. HDV can cause a severe hepatitis, serious consequences with super-infection. Discussed mode of transmission of HDV. Patient with chronic liver diseases should avoid raw sea foods, herbal products, alcohol and should not consume more than 2000 mg of acetaminophen per 24 hour period. Need work up for other chronic liver disease. Need hepatitis A vaccination if not already done so in the past.  Once labs for CHB has confirmed CHB, would consider fibrosis assessment with elastography
Blood in stool. Blood is bright red in nature and is outside of stool. The source for the bleeding could be from hemorrhoids, anal fissure, mucosal tear, rectal ulcer, proctitis/colitis, colon polyps, juvenile polyps and malignancy. Would recommend colon evaluation. He reports that he had colonoscopy done at Sugar Land Medical Center in SL in 2023 but does not recall the physician's name.  Discussed colonoscopy versus sigmoidoscopy and barium enema. Discussed risks, benefits, complications and alternatives. Recommended at least sigmoidoscopy.  Patient opts for no evaluation and declined rectal exam.
Fatty liver on ultrasound.  8/25 TSH 1.18, HDL 27, chol 144, TG 213, LDL 86,, Cr 0.78, AST 16, ALT 17, alk phos 109, Hgb 14 MCV 94.2, platelet 222. Discussed MASLD and CHB.  Recommend lifestyle modification, change in diet and increase exercise to decrease weight. Patient can follow up with primary care physician for evaluation prior to embarking on rigorous exercise program.

liver lesion
History of Present Illness:
Kevin Critchlow is a 37-year-old male who presents to Gastroenterology for evaluation of a liver lesion discovered incidentally on CT scan. The patient reports a history of hematospermia for approximately 3 months, which prompted the initial imaging.
The CT scan, performed at ARA in San Marcos, revealed a well-circumscribed liver lesion measuring 2 to 2.5 centimeters (we do not have reports yet). The patient denies any symptoms related to the liver lesion, including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or blood in the stool. He reports feeling physically healthy overall.
In addition, he reports having routine lab work checked by his PCP prior to the CAT scan at Totals Ment Healthcare in Kyle, Texas and was told lab work was unremarkable. He does not know if liver tests were checked at that time. We will also request records for these.
The patient's hematospermia, which led to the CT scan, has since resolved. He attributes this to inflammation caused by alcohol consumption and other substances. As a result, he has abstained from alcohol for the past few months. Prior to this, he consumed approximately 6 to 8 drinks per week, occasionally up to 10, primarily mixed drinks or beer, with some wine. He also reports rare use of recreational THC.
He denies any significant medical history, chronic diseases, or previous cancer diagnoses. He works remotely for a bank and has not experienced any impact on his daily functioning due to his current health concerns.

anemia, discuss colonoscopy
History of Present Illness:
Thomas Heine is a 54-year-old male with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis who presents to Gastroenterology clinic for evaluation of anemia and unintentional weight loss.
Over the past few months he has experienced unprecedented 20-pound weight loss despite unchanged diet and consumption patterns. Recent bowel habit changes over the past couple weeks include decreased frequency from daily movements to passing ""a small piece of stool"" initially, followed by larger accumulated stool later in the day that he describes as ""18 to 24 inches long."" He notes accompanying change in gas odor, describing it as ""fouled"" and ""molderous."" He uses milk of magnesia as needed for hard stools caused by high fiber intake, taking just enough to ease passage without causing liquid stools.
He denies abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, blood or black color in stool, heartburn, or prior GI procedures. He continues daily bowel movements and maintains ability to work daily. His psoriasis is managed with topical ointment. He reports undiagnosed condition on left foot, possibly dyshidrosis, with ""huge, very itchy, burning blisters that rupture and heal"" in recurring cycles.

Epigastric pain
History of Present Illness:
This 35-year-old male is referred by his primary care physician, Dr. Rika Varani, for evaluation of epigastric pain. The onset of his symptoms was approximately one month ago. He reports a sensation of bloating in the upper abdomen accompanied by pain. The pain is not severe but is elicited and exacerbated by palpation of the epigastric area. He has also experienced a sore throat, which he likens to the sensation of an impending flu, and a change in bowel habits characterized by the sensation of needing to defecate without being able to pass stool. These symptoms began around the same time as the abdominal discomfort. He also reports new-onset, constant headaches for the past month.
He was prescribed Omeprazole by his PCP about a month ago. He notes that if he misses a dose, the epigastric pain seems to worsen. He is unsure if the medication is providing complete relief, but he does notice a negative change when he does not take it.
The patient's symptoms are occurring in the context of new-onset anxiety, which began in July after he was diagnosed with high cholesterol. Following this diagnosis, he began experiencing chest pain and left arm pain, which he feared was cardiac in origin. He was prescribed Atorvastatin. He presented to an emergency room at Methodist where he was evaluated by Dr. Momin. A cardiac workup, including an echocardiogram and a stress test, was performed and the results were normal, ruling out a cardiac etiology for his chest pain. He reports his anxiety has improved somewhat with this reassurance, but he is still struggling with it. He denies any prior history of anxiety.
Prior Tests Reviewed:
- Complete metabolic panel and complete blood count from 07/30/2025 were normal.
- Cardiac troponin was checked during a prior ER visit and was presumably normal.
- An abdominal ultrasound from 08/14/2025 was reported as normal.
- A chest scan from August was noted to be okay, with a subtle elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
- Echocardiogram and stress test were normal.

- The etiology of the dyspeptic symptoms is unclear. An upper endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for peptic ulcer disease, hiatal hernia, or other upper gastrointestinal pathology, especially given the partial response to proton pump inhibitor therapy.
- Investigations planned for Issue 1: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) scheduled for 09/18/2025.
2. Anxiety - F41.9
- This appears to be a new-onset issue, triggered by health concerns. Part of the rationale for the EGD is to provide reassurance and potentially alleviate the gastrointestinal symptoms that may be contributing to or exacerbated by his anxiety.
- No specific treatment was initiated at this time.

She had abdominal ultrasound which was grossly unremarkable. She had MRCP which shows moderate biliary ductal dilatation although no ductal stone or obstructing lesion was identified. She did have some mild hepatic steatosis.
In the hospital was discussed with therapeutic endoscopist who felt like given resolution of pain and improving numbers could be followed as outpatient.
After discharge she had repeat LFTs done which revealed near normalization of her numbers 8/22 save for mild ALT elevation of 71.
Since then she has been feeling well with no abdominal pain. Denies any nausea or vomiting.
No constipation or diarrhea.

Assessment:
This is a 77-year-old female who presents to establish care after admitted to the hospital with acute abdominal pain that resolved spontaneously.
In the hospital she was noted to have significant elevated enzymes. Abdominal ultrasound was normal but MRCP revealed biliary ductal dilatation.
However LFTs trended back down and chronic liver disease workup was negative.
Her follow-up outpatient LFTs reveal near normalization.
Presumably she had some biliary sludge which passed.
Will repeat her LFTs and repeat her MRI. If ongoing signs of bili ductal dilatation will proceed with EUS plus minus ERCP. Otherwise if normal no further workup is needed

DDx mucus in stool includes IBS, constipation, hemorrhoids, IBD, cancer, others. Will focus on improving constipation. Will treat possible hemorrhoids. Recommend regular, gentle cleaning. To monitor for any blood in stool or mucus. To work on improving diet. Increase water intake and fiber in diet. If no improvement or symptoms worsening, to proceed with Colonoscopy next.
DDx of the patient's constipation includes thyroid disease, medications, obstructions, narrowings, slow transit constipation, defecatory disorders, and others. Discussed increase water intake and fiber in diet. Discussed fiber supplement daily. Discussed Miralax titration. Samples of Miralax given.
DDx of the patient's bloating includes but is not limited to celiac disease, malabsorption, IBD, IBS, GERD, functional dyspepsia, Pancreatic Insufficiency, H Pylori, and others. Discussed anti-gas measures. Will work on improving constipation. May try IBgard and probiotic. Samples of IBgard given.
DDx of the patient's heartburn includes GERD, NERD, Hiatal Hernia, H Pylori, Peptic Ulcer Disease, or others. Infrequent. Discussed anti-reflux measures. To try Pepcid PRN.
Plan:
Lose weight with diet/exercise as discussed. Attempt 10% body weight loss over 6 months.*
Consider taking fiber supplement such as Metamucil (psyllium husk - best at bulking), Benefiber (wheat dextrin with prebiotic - can help good gut flora), OR Citrucel (methylcellulose - less gas producing) daily to help stool consistency. Would start the fiber supplement at 2 tablets a day (or 1/2 tbsp a day in water) and increase slowly to 4 tablets, or 2 tablets twice daily (1 tbsp a day). Slow titration may help decrease gas and bloating that can occur when first taking.
For constipation, take Miralax 1/2-1 capful powder once or twice daily. Take on routine basis to avoid constipation. Adjust dose and frequency as needed for desired stool consistency and frequency.
Monitor diet closely and avoid foods that can worsen symptoms, such as: foods high in carbohydrates (fruits and fruit juices), spicy foods, fried foods, and milk products. Consider trying IBGard OTC for gas/bloating. Take 1-2 up to 3 times a day as needed. Consider probiotic daily.

She comes in with several months of GI issues including burning dyspepsia epigastric pain that occurred worse after eating and was typically nonradiating but then eventually moved down to her periumbilical area and became more of a cramping type pain associated with a change in her bowel movements with rarely a formed stool and having 1-2 bowel movements per day with occasional passage of only red blood. She has lost about 25 pounds over the past few months unintentionally.

+Cologuard.  C/O constipation
History of Present Illness:
Ms. Lively is an 89-year-old female seen for fatigue and anemia. She was recently discharged from select rehab after CVA 8/3/2025. History is also notable for CKD 4 and MGUS as well as DM with endorgan disease. She was admitted 7/10/2025 to acute inpatient setting after presenting for shortness of breath and fatigue for 2 weeks. Patient CT of the head showed a new 1.7 cm intraparenchymal hemorrhage of the right occipital lobe. She was seen by surgery but did not require intervention. She was managed medically. Hemoglobin at the time of discharge from inpatient rehab 8/3/2025 was 9.3 with MCV 80.8
Patient comes to clinic today after positive Cologuard was found by PCP. She has a sibling with colorectal cancer. She has had some constipation that she has complained to her son about but apparently this is long-term as patient reports that she typically takes medications entirely for constipation. She reported to her son several days ago that she had some blood in her stool but denies it today to both me and her son. Her son reports that she is from a family of 20 most of whom had cancer. In addition she has lost significant weight over the last several months but this occurs in the setting of a hospitalization. Since her discharge from rehab she has lost from 100 pounds to 96 pounds today. Patient's son reports that she is eating well at home. Patient denies abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting. She has had significant fatigue.

Assessment:
Ms. Lively is an 89-year-old female with family history of colorectal cancer seen for fatigue and anemia and positive Cologuard. Hemoglobin is 9.3 stable from approximately 2 months prior at 8.5. She has had weight loss of approximately 4 pounds since discharge from rehab on 8/3 approximately 6 weeks ago despite a good appetite. CT chest abdomen and pelvis performed in January 2025 showed no obvious lesion in the colon. I discussed with her son that she is extremely high risk for anesthesia right now but there is obvious concern for possible malignancy given her iron deficiency anemia, positive Cologuard, family history. We agreed that in this acute poststroke. We will watch her carefully over the next month for continuing weight loss. If she loses more than approximately 3 pounds in the next month we will proceed to colonoscopy. We will also recheck her hemoglobin today to ensure that it is not worsening. If it is worsening would also recommend colonoscopy. Otherwise, we will see her back in 2 months and likely perform colonoscopy at that time. Son is aware of the risk of anesthesia as well as my grave concern for colorectal cancer. We discussed potentially repeating CT scan abdomen today but her most recent creatinine was 3.67 so this is not feasible.

This is a consultation for a 36-year-old female with a chief complaint of chronic loose stools and significant unintentional weight loss since May 2025.
History of Present Illness:
Latesha is a 36-year-old female who presents for evaluation of a new onset of altered bowel habits and weight loss.
Latesha reports the onset of loose bowels in mid-May 2025. Initially, she experienced multiple loose bowel movements throughout the day, but the pattern has since changed to a single, explosive loose bowel movement first thing in the morning. She describes the stool consistency as typically a Bristol Stool Chart type 5, but has had episodes of type 7. She denies any associated mucus or blood in the stool. There is no nocturnal diarrhea. She reports a sense of urgency in the morning but denies significant abdominal cramping or pain. This represents a significant change from her baseline, which was a normal, formed bowel movement (type 2-3) daily. She also reports significant unintentional weight loss, from 140 pounds in May 2025 to her current weight of 114 pounds. This is associated with a decreased appetite. She has also been experiencing anxiety and depression, for which she was started on Wellbutrin. She notes the Wellbutrin has a constipating effect, and if she were to stop it, the diarrhea would return.
She has no upper gastrointestinal symptoms such as acid reflux or upper abdominal pain. She has tried dietary modifications, including eliminating dairy and consuming prebiotics like kimchi and kefir, without any noticeable improvement in her symptoms. She is a flight attendant and travels internationally, most recently to Mexico.
Her history is notable for taking isotretinoin for acne from April 2024 to August 2024; however, she experienced no gastrointestinal side effects while on the medication. She also had two episodes of illness (strep throat, bronchitis) between November 2024 and January 2025, for which she completed two courses of antibiotics. She has a history of intermittent skin lesions on her arm, which were previously biopsied with inconclusive results.
Due to low ferritin levels, she has received two intravenous iron (Venofer) infusions within the last month and is scheduled for follow-up blood work.

Diagnoses:
Chronic diarrhea

Low ferritin level
Poor appetite
Assessment:
Chronic diarrhea
Unintentional weight loss
Iron deficiency/low ferritin
Loss of appetite
Assessment:
- Chronic diarrhea and weight loss: The primary concern is chronic diarrhea since May 2025, associated with a significant 26-pound weight loss and poor appetite. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes infectious etiologies such as post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome, Clostridium difficile infection (given her antibiotic use earlier in the year), or parasitic infection like Giardia. Inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, is also a consideration, especially given the significant weight loss and systemic symptoms. Her dermatologic manifestations could potentially be an extra-intestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease, although they are non-specific. My suspicion for Crohn's disease is low given the absence of abdominal pain. We discussed these possibilities.
- Iron deficiency: Her ferritin is low, and she has required intravenous iron infusions. This may be related to malabsorption from her gastrointestinal process.
- Procedure counseling: I have discussed the rationale, risks, and benefits of performing both an esophagogastroduodenoscopy and a colonoscopy. I explained that the colonoscopy is crucial for evaluating the colon for inflammation, and the esophagogastroduodenoscopy will allow for examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract, which can also be a source of malabsorption and weight loss. I explained the sedation process and the low-risk nature of the procedures. I also noted that at her age, a colonoscopy would serve as an early screening for colon cancer, which is recommended for African American individuals. She understands the plan and agrees to proceed.
Plan:
I will provide a stool collection kit today to test for infectious etiologies, including Clostridium difficile, Giardia, and other pathogens. I emphasized the importance of returning the sample promptly.
We will schedule an esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy for a comprehensive evaluation. This will allow for direct visualization and biopsies of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract to rule out inflammatory bowel disease or other causes of her symptoms.
She will need a responsible adult to drive her home after the procedures.
Follow up will be scheduled after the procedures to discuss the results and further management.
I reviewed my overall clinical impression, diagnostic strategy and treatment plan with the patient at length. She voiced understanding.

Nausea, Abdominal pain
History of Present Illness:
59-year-old male with history of type 2 diabetes, bipolar, fibromyalgia, GERD, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, sjogrens, cholecystectomy, s/p ERCP for choledocholithiasis in clinic for follow-up visit for nausea and abdominal pain.
Since last office visit patient has been working on slowly tapering of her antipsychotics and mood stabilizers under the supervision of her psychiatrist. She stopped taking carbamazepine 1 week ago. Patient believe this medication change has contributed to improving her nausea. She was also recently diagnosed with tardive dyskinesia.
Nausea/GERD: Symptoms have also improved with dietary changes and Voquezna. There was concern about Voquezna not being covered by insurance. However she is still receiving medication in the mail at this time.

Assessment:
Patient is a 60-year-old white female who presents to our office for follow-up on her GERD, elevated liver function tests her abdominal ultrasound and her labs. She has a history of colon polyps, type II DM, diverticulosis with episodes of diverticulitis, FLD, GERD, hemochromatosis, HTN. She was started on pantoprazole 20 mg daily approximately 6 weeks ago for her GERD symptoms. She reports that she immediately had good relief, no longer having substernal pain or reflux symptoms. She did state that the pharmacy ran out of her medication so she has been out for the past 5 to 7 days. She reports since being off her medication her substernal burning has returned. Therefore she feels the medication was working well and would like to continue. No indication for EGD at this time. She has also stopped her GLP-1 medication as she feels it was not helping her with weight loss. She did state that on Friday night she started with some left lower quadrant abdominal pain and diarrhea. She states the pain and diarrhea is ongoing today, has a history of diverticulosis as well as diverticulitis. We discussed need for CT scan today. Patient denies any hematochezia, no melena, no rectal pain or bleeding. She has not had any nausea, no weight loss, no dysphagia, no hemoptysis.
We discussed her ultrasound which showed mildly increased hepatic echogenicity to include hepatic steatosis.. She has been restarted to have FibroScan done with our office. She had labs on 9/4/2025 that showed inconclusive hep B and hep C series, updated labs ordered today.
We will continue on PPI for 3 to 6 months and then can consider weaning dose as able. Patient will continue to work on weight loss, is seeking out a nonsurgical bariatric clinic.
Plan:
Concerns for acute diverticulitis, CT ordered today, continue PPI daily, will list for fibroscan and repeat hep labs.

Assessment:
69 yr old female wiht PMHx GERD, esophageal stricture, asthma, sarcoidosis present to clinic for acid reflux.
Acid reflux - Pt trialed Voquezna after last OV and now on Pantoprazole with persistent acid reflux sxs - reports that she felt like Omeprazole is what controlled sxs best in past year so will have resume this. If sxs not better controlled after 2 weeks back on this, will trial adding Pepcid in PM prior to PPI BID due to her concern for SEs. Pt advised to update clinic on her sxs in 2 weeks
Dysphagia - solid/pill dysphagia worsening in past few months. Pt reports increased burning in upper chest/throat area with this - she is on inhaler with steroid component? possible candida esophagitis with burning increased vs recurrent stricture. Recommend EGD to evaluate further with dilation if indicated. However, pt also reports that she has had worsening SOB in past month or so - she is pending seeing a new Pulm in Houston next month. Due to sxs and eval pending, we discussed waiting until she has further workup and pt agreeable with this. Will consider EGD in hospital if needed based on pulmonary status
Pt c/o persistent constipation. She is on chronic Mg at home - we discussed trial of increasing dose of this vs Miralax with titration for tx of constipation. Wok on increasing water intake.
Plan:
Recommend checking your Magnesium dose at home - if on low dose can increase to see if this helps your constipation (take 400-800 mg). If you are already on higher dose, then would recommend trial of Miralax for constipation - start 1 cap daily and adjust every 2-3 days based on response
Drink at least 64oz of water daily
Recommend EGD - pending pulmonology evaluation next month so will wait until this is completed to proceed.
Recommend switching PPI back to Omeprazole 40 mg daily as this gave best control in past year. Please take for 2 weeks then update clinic - if your symptoms are persistent then will add Pepcid 40 mg in the evening while pending EGD

4 Months Follow Up
History of Present Illness:
Heather Brinich Langlois is a 41 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit.
With PMHx of Ehlers Danlos syndrome, Ankylosing spondylitis, Psoriatic arthritis, OSA on CPAP, HTN, DM
This is a patient we see for colonic Crohn's and GERD.
She initially established with us in February 2016 presenting with chronic diarrhea, hematochezia, fecal urgency, fecal incontinence, abdominal cramping and nausea. C. difficile was negative. Underwent EGD and colonoscopy March 2016 and her colon showed a normal-appearing TI, patchy superficial ulcerations and erythema throughout the colon but not in the rectum. Colon biopsy in the right colon showed focal chronic inflammation within lamina propria acute activity not identified, and the transverse colon biopsy showed focal active colitis with superficial ulceration, the left colon and rectum were normal. IBD serology lab panel was negative. She was started on Uceris (budesonide) 9mg daily and Lialda 4.8 g daily. November 2016 she developed an anal fissure that progressed to an abscess that required drainage/seton placement. Was placed on Imuran 50 mg daily and took this until 2018 when she wanted to d/c as she felt it was giving her diarrhea/headaches. Noted long history of intermittent infections (on Enbrel) and was frequently on/off Uceris. In February 2019 was tried on Sulfasalazine 1g TID and had d/c it by March 2020. She had held off on anti-TNF alpha drug due to wanting to harvest her eggs for fertility treatment. Repeat colonoscopy May 2020 showed patchy erythema and ulcerations from cecum to sigmoid rectal area. Was started on Stelara May 29th 2020 with her initial infusion, had insurance coverage issues and first injection was August 1st 2020 and then was hospitalized with COVID September 2020 and never went back to taking it, despite our recommendations. In June 2021 she was hospitalized for necrotic wounds from a tummy tuck she had done in Mexico. She was lost to follow up after August 2021 until she returned to see is in October of 2024. She had been admitted at University Health in January 2024 at University. Was placed on budesonide 9 mg in the hospital. Colonoscopy at University Hospital did show small scattered aphthous ulcers throughout the colon and TI consistent with Crohn's. Her MR enterography of the small bowel January 2024 was negative for inflammation in the small bowel. At time of her October 2024 visit when she came back to see she was placed back on Budesonide 9mg daily for 60 days and discussed Skrizi.
Her last visit was February 2025 with Dr. McMyler and at that time she was still taking Budesonide 9mg daily (even though we only sent a 60 day supply), she reported having 2-4 BMs a day, no blood, but did have some fecal urgency. Noted she was on Ozempic and A1c had improved but her weight was stable/unchanged
Last visit May 2025 with me.
GERD is managed with pantoprazole 40 mg and famotidine 40 mg.
Has had prior discussed with recommendation to start on Skyrizi for Crohn's disease management; noted patient was currently on Enbrel for her joint disease. Patient did not want to switch. She was advised to try tapering off of the budesonide slowly and February 2025 was placed on Lialda 4.8 g a day. If she flares then we will need to change her biologic.
At time of May 2025 visit, patient had successfully tapered off the Budesonide and started on Mesalamine 4 pills daily. She reported 3-4 BMs daily with somewhat formed/somewhat loose stools, starts off formed and then becomes more loose. No blood or mucus. No abdominal pain or cramping.
On June 8th graduates with MBA
Has history of Ehler Danlos as well as ankylosing spondylitis. Is on Enbrel for her joint pain/AS and seeing Dr. Rosenberg (Rheumatologist) and also follows with pain specialist for chronic knee/back pain and an orthopedic surgeon. Noted she has been on Cimzia and her Humira in the past for her arthritis.
Currently, patient reports did meet with her rheumatologist Dr rosenberg last thursday and discussed that with her ankylosing spondylitis that the skyrizi would not cover that, so may not be the best choice for her.  She feels that she is doing okay on the Lialda.  Says every few days will have an episode of fecal urgency  but otherwise BMs have been doing well.  Has a BM when she wakes up in the morning and then 2-3 throughout the day and then one in the evening and are formed. No mucus or blood. Takes the Lialda 2 in the morning and 2 in the evening.    She tells me that she has gained weight, despite being on Mounjaro. Tells me that for her, this is sometimes a symptom that something is wrong with her body and that there may be inflammation going on.

Assessment:
40 year old female we see for colonic crohn's disease, initially diagnosed in 2016 and placed on Budesonide and Lialda at that time. Later placed on Imuran from November 2016-2018. Then sulfasalazine 2019-2020. in May 2020 was started on Stelara but had insurance coverage issues. She was lost to follow up 2021-2024.
Had colonoscopy in January 2024 (with University Health) that did show active disease also biopsies in the TI were positive. Her MRI enterography Jan 2024 of the small bowel was negative but showed suboptimal distention of the small bowel. Repeat MRI November 1, 2024 showed negative MR enterography exam. No current evidence of abnormal wall thickening or active inflammation. No perianal inflammation in the right posterior perianal fistula seen in 2016 has resolved. Was placed back on Lialda 4 pills daily in February 2025.
Currently taking Lialda 4 pills daily. She is having 3-6 bowel movements daily that start off formed and then become mildly loose. She is currently on Enbrel for her joint disease. There has been discussions at past visits about consideration for Skyrizi, however her Rheumatologist mentioned this may not be the best choice since it would not cover her ankylosing spondylitis.  She will continue on Lialda 4 pills daily for now.   We will check a fecal calprotectin as she states she does worry she may have inflammation going on because she has been gaining weight, despite being on Mounjaro (she states weight gain is a symptom of inflammation for her).  Will also check a TSH.  Will have her follow up with Dr. McMyler at next visit to discuss timing of her next colonoscopy for IBD surveillance.
GERD is doing well on pantoprazole 40 mg once daily and famotidine 40 mg once in the evening. She will continue regimen.
Plan:
Fecal calprotectin
TSH with reflex to T4
Follow up with Dr Mcmyler in 4 months"

Colitis
History of Present Illness:
Gregory Gordon is a 53 year old  male patient who is seen at the request of Timothy Hernandez for a consultation/initial visit.He presents for evaluation after a recent episode of what is likely an infectious colitis which occurred on an international return flight from Spain. He developed fevers, chills, and nausea, followed by profound diarrhea which is primarily watery and right-sided abdominal pain. After several days of discomfort, he went to a local ER for evaluation and had the workup mentioned below. His symptoms have improved over time and he did complete a 3-day course of therapy with Cipro. He had no hematochezia. There is no history of similar complaints in the past. There were no sick contacts or other obvious exposure while he was traveling. Last colonoscopy was in 2016 and was unremarkable, and he has had imaging studies on several occasions since then which showed no comparable findings.
CT 2016-no acute process
EGD and colonoscopy 2016-class A esophagitis, H. pylori negative gastropathy, otherwise normal including duodenal biopsies, normal colonoscopy with random biopsies
EGD 2021-hiatal hernia, erosive gastropathy and duodenitis
Gastric emptying study 2022-delayed emptying with half emptying time of 208 minutes and mild gastroesophageal reflux
CT 2022-no acute process, diverticulosis, prior ventral hernia repair
Labs 2022-normal CMP, normal hepatic enzymes, normal CBC with platelets, negative celiac serologies, normal TSH, urea breath test negative, ANA positive with a titer of 1-80
ER evaluation 9/2025-multiple benign hepatic cysts, largest 6.3 cm, benign renal cysts measuring up to 4 cm. Pancolitis most severe at the proximal transverse and hepatic flexure region with no dilation with moderate pericolonic inflammatory change with hyperemia and vascular dilation and reactive adenopathy with normal-appearing appendix. White blood cell count 10.7, hematocrit 41, creatinine 0.9, glucose 112, normal hepatic enzymes

Diagnoses:
Colitis presumed infectious
GERD with esophagitis 1
Hepatic cyst
Assessment:
Colitis, likely infectious-Differential diagnosis and diagnostic evaluation were discussed. Findings are consistent with a self-limited infectious process, especially given the acuity of onset, association with fevers and chills, absence of other clear etiology based on imaging, and resolution after antibiotic therapy. It is reassuring that previous imaging studies were unremarkable as well. I suspect a self-limited process with no need for further intervention
GERD-Longstanding and associated with a history of mild peptic esophagitis. No consistent therapy at this time is necessary. Recommend upper endoscopy at time of colonoscopy as below.
Screening for colorectal cancer-he is due for screening having last undergone examination in 2016. Options remain broad, but given the nature of recent symptoms I favor colonoscopy. The risks and benefits reviewed and he agrees to proceed
Hepatic cysts- we reviewed that hepatic cysts are commonly identified on routine imaging and that typical imaging modalities such as ultrasound or adequate to make a clear diagnosis and exclude other concerning pathology. we also reviewed that most cysts are asymptomatic and do not require serial imaging because they lack malignant potential. Given the features radiographically, mucinous cystic neoplasm, echinococcal cyst, and other atypical cysts or metastases appear very unlikely. Also, the features of this process are not consistent with polycystic liver based on the cyst number and characteristics. Further therapy is not indicated in this case unless symptoms develop. We discussed potential symptoms associated with hepatic cysts and the patient will contact us if these present themselves.. Otherwise, no further imaging is indicated

History of Present Illness:
Ms. Taylor is a 79 year old patient who presents for a follow up evaluation on constipation and rectal bleeding. She was seen 3/2021 for rectal bleeding, and an atypical lesion was noted, prompting a referral to colorectal surgery for further evaluation. Workup confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the anus. She has been lost to follow up since 2021. She presents back today at first saying she is doing fine.  Her caregiver says notes that Ms. Taylor has constipation, and often has to strain to have a bowel movement. She can also have some abdominal pain associated with having to have a bowel movement. She has a bowel movement every 2-3 days. She can have bright red blood in the toilet or with wiping sometimes after a bowel movement, but they haven't noticed blood in the stool. She confirms Pantoprazole 40 mg is working well for her GERD. She denies dysphagia or unexplained weight loss. She is still following with oncology, and most recently had chemotherapy November 2022 to January 2023. She has a history of anal squamous cell cancer, though this recurrence was in the groin area.
Patient continues to follow-up with Dr. Luis Rodriguez with most recent office visit in our system in April 2024. CT abdomen pelvis at that time with evidence of cholelithiasis, left upper quadrant diverticulitis, mesenteric twist with severe narrowing versus occlusion of the SMV.

Patient being referred for rectal bleeding and history of an external hemorrhoid. She says that she has had hemorrhoids for years and they have involved in her but He in the last 6 months she has been noting blood per rectum. She says that the bleeding happens a few times a week and varies in the amount. She states that she feels like something is blocking the exit of her anus at times making it difficult for her to fully evacuate and having to strain. She says that she has some occasional pain from the hemorrhoid. She has not tried any treatments for it and has not had a rectal exam. She has a bowel movement daily but it is hard to push out. She is on an iron supplement due to a history of iron deficiency anemia from menorrhagia. She says that her stools have become dark since starting on the iron. She had an IUD placed in July and has not had any menstrual bleeding since then. Prior to that she used to have menstrual bleeding for up to a whole month at a time. Her last labs were in June and not available for review. No family history of GI cancers. No prior endoscopy or colonoscopy. No other alarm symptoms.

Dyspepsia/Early satiety
History of Present Illness:
Russell is here today in follow-up on his chronic issues with belching and early satiety and dyspepsia. Also, a few months ago he started noticing some dysphagia. He had an evaluation with SLP on the 15th and is pending SLP therapy. He had a barium swallow which noted mildly delayed transit and some tertiary contractions with no mechanical issues and the tablet passed normally into the stomach. He admits he switched to famotidine as he had some sluggishness with the Nexium. However, his reflux got much worse after going to famotidine and this is around the time his dysphagia with pills started. He had dizziness with rabeprazole, previously failed pantoprazole after being on this for a long time, now nexium and famotidine. He also was on omeprazole in the past. x

GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease)
Assessment:
Russell is a vigorous 75-year-old black male with history of Raynaud's, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and OSA. He presents today in follow-up) for issues with reflux and recent development of dysphagia. It is certainly suspicious that his dysphagia seemed to occur once he was switched off of PPI and onto famotidine and has had some increased reflux symptoms as well. He did have a barium swallow with his primary care provider which did note concern for mildly delayed transit and tertiary contractions which would certainly be consistent with a reflux induced dysmotility. We discussed options and he prefers to be conservative with trying a different reflux medication. Since he has failed all PPIs available on DOD formulary, will try with low-dose Voquezna and continue with famotidine as well. Should he fail to respond to this it may be reasonable to consider pH impedance and manometry.
Plan:
Voquezna 10 mg Take 1 tablet by mouth, with or without food, once a day, swallow whole,do not chew or crush
Additional Notes:
Thank you for the chance to care for Russell today."

Patient denies vomiting, melena, lightheadedness, dizziness, or syncope.
09/10/25-Today
Christian Gonzales is a 30 year old male who is seen today for a follow-up visit for UC. After our last visit, patient was unfortunately admitted to the hospital due to increase in severity of his symptoms despite remaining on prednisone. During his admission, he did not improve on IV steroids, was thus started on Remicade and completed 2 infusions during that admission. Since then, he has had an additional infusion and was pending another in 6 days. Patient has noted significant improvement in his symptoms since starting Remicade, and also remains on mesalamine 4.8 g daily along with a prednisone taper currently at 15 mg a day and is tapering down 5 mg every week. He is now having 5 bowel movements a day with stools at a 5 on the BSS that are often looser in the morning and become more formed throughout the day. He does continue to have nocturnal bowel movements, but down to once a night rather than several times a night. Patient no longer sees hematochezia and denies tenesmus. However, he does continue to have abdominal cramping predominantly in the left lower quadrant after his bowel movements that is significantly worse in the morning, and alleviated with dicyclomine as needed. Patient also reports occasional rectal pain with defecation. Patient's throat has been slightly dry since his discharge, b and also admits to mild nausea. However, his appetite is back to baseline and is tolerating a normal diet. Patient denies tenesmus, vomiting, fevers, hematochezia, melena, dizziness, or lightheadedness. He does not monitor his weight at home. He has been back to work for the last 2 weeks and doing well.

Abdominal cramping
Assessment:
Christian Gonzalez is a pleasant 30-year-old male who presents to clinic for a flare of ulcerative proctosigmoiditis. Unfortunately, patient was ultimately hospitalized for his flare and during this admission had inductions of Remicade. Since his discharge, patient has noted significant improvement in his symptoms now having 5 bowel movements a day that are loose and formed without hematochezia. However, he continues to have nocturnal bowel movements and abdominal cramping. Considering his symptoms have significantly improved, I do recommend that he continue on his current medical course with the Remicade infusions, mesalamine 4.8 g daily, and complete the prednisone taper as directed as it will likely take additional time to induce complete remission. I also encouraged patient to continue supportive measures including avoid NSAIDs and utilize dicyclomine/Tylenol as needed for cramping. Strict ER/return precautions were discussed. We will also repeat laboratory studies at this time for surveillance. Patient expressed understanding and agreed with plan.
Plan:
Complete Blood Count (CBC) with Diff
Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)
C-Reactive Protein (CRP)
Avoid NSAIDs (Motrin, Advil, ibuprofen, Aleve, Naproxen, etc.)
Follow-up office visit in 4-6 weeks

- Arrange for blood work to elucidate the etiology of liver enzyme elevation.
- Arrange for liver elastography to evaluate for fibrosis. If elevated, consider liver biopsy as the next step.
2. Liver lesion: Recent ultrasound revealed an incidental finding of a liver lesion, suggestive of hemangioma. MRI is already arranged on 9/24/25 by Dr. Kromann Martin (PCP).
- Follow up the liver MRI for further characterization.
3. Gallbladder polyp: He has a history of gallbladder polyp dating back 5 years, previously reportedly 4 mm in size. Ultrasound this year (done in China) revealed an incidental finding of a 6 mm gallbladder polyp.
The size difference could be related to where the imaging was performed and operator dependent.

Constipation
History of Present Illness:
Thank you so much for referring your patient for an initial gastroenterology consultation. History was obtained from the patient and father. The patient had a history of constipation since infancy, with symptoms worsening over the past couple of years. The patient had been on and off MiraLAX to manage constipation, which exacerbates when not on the medication. Even when on MiraLAX, the patient hesitated to use the bathroom and experienced occasional accidents. The patient did not report abdominal pain but had episodes of stool leakage. The patient had been on the current dose of MiraLAX for about two weeks, following previous cycles over the past four years. No significant weight gain or growth concerns were noted, though the patient had always been on the smaller side. The patient was slow to talk and walk during early development. There were no known food allergies or special diet requirements. The patient consumed a limited diet with insufficient fruits and vegetables and no known avoidance of specific food proteins.

Chaperoned by:	N/A.
Diagnoses:
Constipation, slow transit
Encopresis
Assessment:
1. Chronic Constipation: The most likely cause of the patient's symptoms, given the long-standing history and response to MiraLAX. Despite the use of MiraLAX, the patient continued to experience issues, suggesting possible inadequate bowel clearance or dietary insufficiencies.
2. Dietary Insufficiencies: The patient's limited intake of fiber from fruits and vegetables might contribute to the constipation, as fiber is crucial in maintaining regular bowel movements.
3. Possible Underlying Condition: Consideration for underlying conditions such as celiac disease or thyroid dysfunction due to family history and prolonged symptoms. Blood tests were planned to rule out these possibilities.
PLAN:
Treatment:
- Continued MiraLAX: half a capful daily
- Encouraged increased water intake to 24 ounces daily
- Recommended increasing dietary fiber with three servings of fruits and vegetables daily
Tests:
- Blood work to screen for celiac disease, thyroid function, and check electrolytes
- Abdominal X-ray to assess for fecal impaction
Patient Education:
- Discussed importance of fiber and hydration in managing constipation
- Encouraged presenting foods in a manner acceptable to the patient to increase intake
Follow-Up:
- Planned follow-up appointment after test results to evaluate effectiveness of interventions and further management
Plan:
Complete Blood Count (CBC) with Diff
C-Reactive Protein (CRP)
Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)
Celiac Ab profile: tTg IgG/IgA, DGP IgG/IgA, total IgA
TSH with reflex to T4
Abdomen X-ray 1 view (KUB) - 74018
Additional Notes:
stat xray to be read by peds radiology.  Goal is 24 ounces of water and 3 servings of a combination of fruits/veggies daily."

Follow Up
History of Present Illness:
This is a 66-year-old male presenting for a follow-up visit for liver cirrhosis, iron deficiency anemia, and hepatitis B core antibody positive status. This is a follow-up from a visit in April. The purpose of this visit is to review recent investigations and monitor his conditions. He reports feeling better and his anemia has resolved. He denies seeing any blood in his stool. He has a history of bullous skin lesions, for which he was previously on Rituxan, but this was discontinued approximately one year ago. He also has a history of hiatal hernia and a tortuous esophagus. He has been abstinent from alcohol for four years.
Prior Tests Reviewed:
- An ultrasound of the liver performed in May at HCA hospital showed no evidence of liver cancer or gallstones. It did note a possible kidney stone, which is not of clinical significance.
- Blood work from May was reviewed. Liver function tests show a slightly elevated AST of 42 and alkaline phosphatase of 206, with other liver numbers being within normal limits. INR is 1.2. Platelet count is 316,000, which is a good number for an individual with cirrhosis.
- The alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) cancer marker was 1.2, which is well below the concerning threshold of 6.
- Hepatitis B DNA is not detectable.
- A prior upper endoscopy from 2022 showed a hiatal hernia and a tortuous esophagus, but no esophageal varices.
- A colonoscopy performed at the same time as the 2022 EGD had a suboptimal prep but was otherwise unremarkable.
4/29/2025 Patient is here for routine follow up after 6 months. He remains wheelchair bound and overall deconditioned with associated weight loss. Since last visit, he was hospitalized for pneumonia and was discharged for SNF, where he received inpatient rehab. He is currently receiving home health services for PT/OT. He has not seen his dermatologist in over 6 months and has not received Rituxan infusion in 1 year. He is no longer on chronic steroids and reports that his bullous pemphigoid is in remission. I counseled that he can stop tenofovir. He is overdue for labs and liver imaging, which I will order today. Of note, he has not been taking pantoprazole at home, which I will refill today. He was recently started on Plavix for ""bad circulation in legs"" a couple of months ago. Will try to call his sister next week to confirm name of vascular surgeon to discuss indication for Plavix. He is high risk for GI bleeding given recurrent esophagitis and ulcers with associated bleeding. He is overdue for EGD for variceal screening, but he is deferring this for now given his insurance is out of network with all of the hospitals that I offer endoscopy.
10/7/2024 This is a telehealth appointment conducted from my office at 11920 Astoria Blvd Suite 410 Houston, TX 77089 using audio connection only. Appropriate informed consent was obtained. This is a follow up appointment. Patient unfortunately suffered from a fall onto his R shoulder and hip and has since had pain in his R leg preventing him from walking. He has been using a wheelchair for his mobility needs. He presented to ER acutely after fall, and all of his x-rays were negative at the time. He has repeat scans later this month with his PCP given ongoing pain and weakness. He has not followed up with dermatologist since we last spoke with him. I spoke with his dermatology PA 2 weeks ago, who said patient would likely need another dose of Rituxan for his bullous pemphigoid but has been lost to follow up. He has apparently been refilling his steroids but patient denies taking steroids and reports that his skin is currently clear. I recommended following up with dermatology when he can to be reassessed for another round of Rituxan. He remains on HBV prophylaxis daily and is tolerating medication well. He is taking ibuprofen daily for his leg pain, which I recommended he stop given his history of IDA and GI bleeding. He will take low dose Tylenol PRN instead and discuss pain management strategies with his PCP. His is due for HCC surveillance. Patient has poor health literacy and poor social support, and he is now wheelchair bound, which has contributed to poor follow up with his specialists.
07/01/2024 This is a follow up appointment. Patient was started on Rituxan for his bullous pemphigoid in 04/24. He was started on Viread at the same time for HBV prophylaxis due to findings of HBcAb+ indicating prior exposure or prior HBV infection. He stopped taking Viread temporarily in 05/24 due to concern for it possibly causing joint pain but the restarted medication without side effects later in 05/24 and is tolerating well. He had follow up with his dermatologist in 06/24 and noted that he does not have any plans for upcoming Rituxan infusions. He remains on methylprednisone 4mg QD and is taking PPI QD for GI prophylaxis. Recent labs showed slightly elevated LFTs but normal AFP and no significant anemia. His weight is stable at 170lbs. He is due for variceal screening but wishes to hold off given facility is out of network and stable clinical status. He will be due for liver imaging in 09/24, which I will order today. He will need to be on HBV prophylaxis x 6 months after completing Rituxan.
03/19/2024 He is here for follow-up. Denies any nausea vomiting hematemesis or melena. He remains on treatment with steroids for bullous pemphigoid, plans to start an infusion treatment with his dermatologist soon. He is due for an upper endoscopy but his local hospital is out of network and he wishes to wait until it becomes a lot worse.
1/9/2024 Patient is here for follow up after 3 months. Patient has gained 20lbs since last office visit, which he attributes to increased appetite. Denies swelling in legs, hands, or stomach. Denies abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting. He remains on lactulose, which keeps his stools regular. Denies visible GI bleeding. Labs in 12/23 with  AST 61, ALT 110, WBC 11.4. He is due for liver imaging, which I will order today. He will also be due for EGD for variceal screening in a couple of months, which I will order today. He reports a new diffuse rash on his trunk that is pruritic and looks different from his bullous pemphigoid. His dermatologist is working up the rash currently. He remains on methylprednisone daily.
10/9/23 This is a telehealth appointment conducted from my office at 11920 Astoria Blvd Suite 410 Houston, TX using audio connection only. Appropriate informed consent was obtained. This is a follow up visit. Labs in 06/23 with AST 41, ALT 60, which are increased from previous panel. Patient denies drinking for last 6 months. Ultrasound of liver in 07/23 with no masses or evidence of HCC. Today, he reports feeling well. He denies abdominal pain, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, visible edema, visible GI bleeding. He remains on PPI daily for reflux with relief of symptoms. He also remains on methylprednisone 4mg QD for bullous pemphigoid. He is requesting refill of lactulose, which I will send today. Follow up in 3 months.
6/27/2023 He is here for routine follow-up. Reflux is under control. He remains on steroids for bullous pemphigoid condition. He remains on pantoprazole twice a day and I recommended that he can cut it down to once a day for the time being. He is due for surveillance. Hepatocellular carcinoma - labs and US ordered. He is requesting a refill for proton pump inhibitor and lactulose.
10/11/2022 He is here for follow-up. He states that he stopped drinking alcohol as of 3 months. No recent labs. He had abnormal liver function tests in June but he was also actively drinking at that time. He is due for repeat labs and ultrasound for hepatocellular carcinoma screening
06/14/2022 He is here for follow-up. He was noted to have elevated liver function tests on the most recent lab draw 3 weeks ago with ALT of 416, AST of 216 alkaline phosphatase 175 1 distal count elevated at 12,000 platelet count 471. He does acknowledge that he started drinking again drinks up to 3-4 beers a day. I have again recommended abstinence from alcohol. Patient lives alone and does not seem to have good social support as he did not come with his sister on this visit. Recent EGD and colonoscopy results were discussed with the patient. He has a large hiatal hernia and small nonbleeding ulcers in the stomach. Portal gastropathy changes noted. I recommend that he is continue with the PPI use for the time being. Recommended avoiding NSAIDs.
04/11/2022 This is a telehealth visit being conducted at the request of patient from my office using bidirectional synchronous video communication tool. Appropriate informed consent was obtained. Patient has had trouble scheduling EGD and colonoscopy due to insurance approvals. Risks and benefits of EGD and colonoscopy were discussed. He states that most recent labs from his hematologist show improvement in hemoglobin. Denies any gross bleeding. He is not taking NSAIDs at this time. Remains on lactulose and pantoprazole.
02/07/2022 This is a telehealth visit being conducted at the request of patient from my office (11920 Astoria Blvd, St 410, Houston 77089) using audio only communication since video is unavailable. Appropriate consent was obtained. This is a routine follow-up after 2 months. Patient reports doing well overall. Denies any significant reflux or dysphagia. He remains on PPI twice daily as instructed. He has stopped NSAID use as well but remains on methylprednisolone from his dermatologist. Discussed recommendations for repeat EGD given gastric ulcers and intestinal metaplasia on biopsies. He is also overdue for colonoscopy given poor prep in 2017. Discussed completing both procedures at the same time which he is interested in. Patient request that we call his sister Brenda who will be his driver on the day of the procedure. Total time spent was 20 minutes.
11/30/2021 This is a telehealth visit being conducted at the request of patient from my office (11920 Astoria Blvd, St 410, Houston 77089) using bidirectional synchronous video communication tool. Appropriate informed consent was obtained. His sister was also present on the call. This is a procedure follow-up after recent EGD. We discussed procedure findings in detail including multiple antral ulcers, 7 cm x 7 cm hiatal hernia, and GE junction stenosis which was dilated to 20 mm. Interestingly, he denies any dysphagia before or after procedure. Biopsies were negative for malignancy and showed chronic active gastritis with intestinal metaplasia. We discussed the potential precancerous nature of these findings especially in light of ulcers and chronic gastritis. I recommended repeat EGD in 3 to 6 months and continue PPI bid in the meantime. I also recommended NSAID avoidance including meloxicam. Patient is currently being weaned off methylprednisolone which was prescribed by his dermatologist.
08/09/2021 This is a telehealth visit being conducted at the request of patient from my office using bidirectional synchronous video communication tool. Appropriate informed consent was obtained. Since last visit he underwent hip replacement without any complications. As for cirrhosis is concerned he appears to be well compensated. Denies any GI bleed or encephalopathy. He is coming up due for an upper endoscopy for surveillance for both gastric ulcers, esophageal varices and large hiatal hernia which will be scheduled later this year. Risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed in detail.
05/06/2021 This is a telehealth visit being conducted at the request of patient from my office using audio connection. Appropriate informed consent was obtained. This is a follow-up visit. Patient reports improvement in symptoms. Most recent hemoglobin is around 12.5. He denies any bleeding. He is seeing an orthopedic physician due to avascular necrosis of the right hip or plans for potential surgery. No absolute contraindications from a cirrhosis standpoint since that he appears well compensated at this time. Last platelet count is around 350. We will follow-up back with him in about 3 months. Tele health time 15 mins.
03/16/2021 He is here for follow-up with his sister after 6 months. He remains abstinent from alcohol. He has been developing bilateral pedal edema that went to the emergency room recently and was discharged with steroids. Also has slight shortness of breath. He had labs done with his PCP as well as hematologist recently and will try to obtain them. He did receive 1 infusion of IV iron as well. Denies any GI bleed.

Hemoglobin was noted to be around 8.1 with MCV of 78.1 white blood cell count was 11.5 iron is 18 ferritin 33 suggestive of iron deficiency as well. He has been on oral iron supplementation twice a day and IV iron supplementation as needed with hematology. Alpha-fetoprotein is normal at 1.6. Last ultrasound was in March without any evidence of liver tumor. He remains on pantoprazole twice a day given prior history of severe reflux esophagitis and hiatal hernia. His stools are dark since our iron supplementation but he denies any hematemesis or GI bleed. Last upper endoscopy was in November 2019 with evidence of bile acid reflux, large hiatal hernia. Last colonoscopy was in November 2017 with findings of diverticulosis no polyps. He is on CellCept for bullous pemphigoid and apparently has been doing very well. Tele time 25 min.
08/25/2020 This is a telehealth visit being conducted at the request of patient from my office using audio only connection since attempts at bidirectional synchronous video communication tool failed. Appropriate informed consent was obtained. This is a routine follow-up visit done via audio visit. Patient reports overall stable health, currently living with his mother. He had an ultrasound done in March which did not show any liver lesions. Fatty liver changes were noted. Last labs in February shows that the virus remains in suppression. He does complain of constipation and have recommended that he take Colace as needed and we will also call in a prescription for lactulose. He has an appointment with his primary care physician next week and I recommended that he get liver function panel done with her and have her fax the results to us. We will follow-up back with him in 6 months. He will be due for an upper endoscopy in November 2021. Total telehealth audio time is 25 minutes.

He is currently on CellCept for severe bullous pemphigoid skin lesions and appears to be tolerating it well under the direction of his dermatologist.
12/24/2019 He has started hepatitis C treatment with Mavyret. No side effects. He is changing insurances next month and would like a refill sent. It was recommended that we do labs upon completion of treatment.
11/26/2019 He is here with his sister for procedure follow up. Reviewed recent EGD results including moderate gastritis, erosive duodenitis, large hiatal herania, and bile reflux gastritis. He denies any abdominal pain or acid reflux symptoms recently. Recommend PPI daily and Carafate 2-3 times daily before meals. He may crush tablets and mix with water if they are difficult to swallow. He does take Aleve for back pain every day. Following with neurosurgeon who is planning laminectomy and fusion for him pending GI clearance for history of cirrhosis. Reviewed recent labs which show normal platelets and bilirubin levels, INR within normal limits as well. He is cleared for planned procedure at moderate risk. Recommend avoidance of NSAIDs and limit operative time.
07/30/2019 He is here after over a year. Since the last visit he has been admitted to the hospital in July 2018 with acute alcohol intoxication. He has admitted himself to outpatient alcohol rehab program and is currently sober for the last 3 months. He has gone through a series of inpatient rehabilitation and is currently on outpatient program. He states that he is overall doing much better. He wants to proceed with hepatitis C treatment. He remains on steroids for pemphigoid bullous under dermatology supervision. We will restage his hepatitis C disease, repeat RNA marker, repeat ultrasound of the liver, check AFP to survey for liver cancer and repeat EGD given history of severe esophagitis, hiatal hernia and gastric ulceration. New Derm - Dr Drousou, Pearland.

Unspecified cirrhosis of liver - compensated; Hep C + ETOH, no varices
Hepatitis B core antibody positive - Off Viread as he is off Rituxan
Hiatal hernia - large 7cm
Osteopenia
Esophagitis (Reflux) w large hiatal hernia
Assessment:
1. Liver Cirrhosis, stable - K74.60
- The cirrhosis appears to be stable with good synthetic function, as evidenced by the normal INR and good platelet count. The surveillance ultrasound and AFP are reassuring and negative for hepatocellular carcinoma.
- Plan is for continued monitoring.
- Will continue six-monthly follow-up appointments.
2. Hepatitis B core antibody positive - Z22.51
- The patient's hepatitis B DNA is undetectable. He was previously on tenofovir (Viread) for prophylaxis while on Rituxan for his skin condition.
- Given that the Rituxan was stopped approximately one year ago, the tenofovir is no longer medically necessary.
- Instructed to discontinue tenofovir.
3. Esophageal varices screening - Z13.818
- The last upper endoscopy was in 2022, and it is recommended to repeat this for screening of esophageal varices, which are a known complication of cirrhosis.
- An upper endoscopy will be ordered to screen for varices and evaluate his known hiatal hernia and reflux symptoms. The procedure will be scheduled at the Pearland Surgery Center due to insurance constraints with Memorial Hermann. Staff will assist with scheduling.
4. Medication Refills - Z76.0
- Refill for lactulose was sent to CVS pharmacy as requested.
- A prescription for pantoprazole for acid reduction was also sent to CVS pharmacy.
Plan:
Follow-up office visit in 6 months

liver thrombus f/u
History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 71-year-old male with past medical history significant for NASH, CAD, diabetes, HLD, HTN, OSA on CPAP recent diagnosis of SMV thrombus who presents to clinic today for follow-up.
Patient was admitted to the ICU at Baylor Irving, followed by Dr. Mahatma, for SMV thrombosis with extension to the mesenteric veins and portal vein along with mesenteric edema. There is questionable evidence of nodular contoured appearance of liver on prior CT abdomen and pelvis, but no such appearance on most recent CT scan and no other evidence of cirrhosis. There was mention of ischemic enteritis secondary to mesenteric and portal vein thrombosis. Thus far, cirrhosis and viral/autoimmune workup negative. Suspected to likely have underlying steatohepatitis. Patient currently follows with hematologist, Dr. Juvvadi, who is following the patient while on Eliquis. While inpatient surgery and IR was consulted and recommended placement of thrombolysis catheter. Repeat on 6/25 showed persistent SMV thrombosis and was recommended to continue thrombolysis for additional 24 hours. Patient with no GI complaints at this time, denies any melena, hematochezia, unintentional weight loss, loss of appetite reflux or dysphagia.
Most recent labs show BUN 14, creatinine 0.9, ALP 102, AST 25, ALT 23, bilirubin 1.0, H&H 13.1/40.9, MCV 91.9, platelet count 188,000, PT/INR 13.0/1.1. Negative CEA/CA 19.9.
Patient has upcoming appointment with hematology this week. Plan is to continue Eliquis indefinitely for now. Patient reports that he was diagnosed with factor II deficiency on hematologic workup. Inciting event for original clot, believed to be related to IVIG infusion. Patient had started IVIG infusions for an undisclosed immunodeficiency, but was only able to receive 1 infusion until he was hospitalized for his SMV thrombosis.

diarrhea
History of Present Illness:
Constance Ginn is a 71 year old  female patient who is seen at the request of Vipulkumar Patel for a consultation/initial visit.
Patient presents today for follow-up of chronic diarrhea, which has been ongoing for many years (patient states 'over twenty years'). Reports experiencing diarrhea 2-3 times per week, with occasional episodes of fecal urgency and incontinence. Patient describes a recent incident where they had an accident while moving from the couch to the bathroom. The diarrhea appears to be random but often occurs in the morning. Patient expresses concern about leaving home due to fear of having accidents in public. Denies blood in stool, weight loss, or trouble swallowing. Patient reports feeling otherwise healthy but notes significant impact on quality of life due to symptoms.
Patient has a history of microscopic lymphocytic colitis diagnosed on previous biopsies. Has previously been treated with medications including Valsalamine and Budesonide (Entocort) with good response. Patient reports that previous medication regimen had completely resolved symptoms and allowed them to feel 'secure about going out.' Currently using Pepto-Bismol with some relief.
Patient also has a history of MS, diagnosed approximately 10 years ago, and is followed by Dr. Patel (PCP) and a neurologist. Denies current significant life stressors or anxiety.
Review of Medical Records:
- Previous diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) reported in the past, though Prometheus testing was not consistent with IBD
- Previous biopsy confirmed lymphocytic colitis (microscopic colitis)
- Prior treatments included cholestyramine, Budesonide, and Valsalamine in 2015
- Records indicate complete resolution of diarrhea with previous medication regimen
- Comorbid conditions include MS and hypercholesterolemia

Assessment:
I have reviewed available records and discussed them with patient. We have discussed current clinical scenario and the differential diagnosis.
1. Microscopic Lymphocytic Colitis with chronic diarrhea
- Patient with long-standing history of microscopic colitis with current symptomatic relapse
- Symptoms significantly impacting quality of life with fear of leaving home due to urgency and occasional incontinence
- Plan for colonoscopy with biopsies to reassess disease status and confirm diagnosis
- In the interim, recommended over-the-counter management with Imodium and/or Pepto-Bismol as needed
- Will consider restarting previous effective medication regimen (likely Budesonide) after confirmation of diagnosis
- Discussed newer medication options that may be available depending on colonoscopy findings
2. Multiple Sclerosis
- Currently managed by neurology
- No acute neurological complaints today
- Continue current management with neurologist

Gastritis
History of Present Illness:
Sam is a very pleasant 43-year-old male with BMI of 25 presents to the office today to see me in consultation from Dr. Kundur, accompanied by his father with noncardiac chest pain. He has had a previous history of similar, had an endoscopy done over 5 years ago for similar situations that presented with dysphagia and chest discomfort with regurgitation, endoscopically with benign esophageal stricture treated with therapeutic dilation at the time and he had done well on PPI therapy. He does have poor dietary habits stemming from his opportunity where he works for unlimited soda and his mental delay and cognitive issues. In early August on the eighth and 2025 he was exhibiting very similar symptoms and his father took him to the emergency department, cardiac etiology was ruled out and a suspected recurrent gastritis. Given a prescription for Prilosec that has markedly improved but not completely eliminated his symptoms. He denies any solid or liquid dysphagia but does have some occasional nausea and vomiting and regurgitation. Weight is stable

Regurgitation of food (c)
Assessment:
43-year-old male with a BMI of 25 with a previous history of hiatal hernia with esophageal stricture and esophagitis, history of long-term but stable mental retardation with significant dietary indiscretions as a behavioral habit that had induced symptoms in the past of bloating and intermittent abdominal discomfort along with noncardiac chest pain. Recent evaluation a month ago in the emergency department shows no cardiac etiology, some improvement but not at all completely resolving his symptoms with PPI therapy. Strongly discussed with patient and his father the importance of dietary modification and limiting soda and junk food, continue with PPI therapy and based upon his presentation I think it reasonable to evaluate with endoscopy to see if the stricture has reformed that he is feeling as regurgitation with nausea and vomiting
Plan:
Lose weight with diet/exercise as discussed. Attempt 10% body weight loss over 6 months.*
Adhere to lifestyle and dietary modifications for GERD diet as we discussed. This includes avoiding fatty and greasy foods, fried foods, tomato based foods, caffeine, carbonated drinks, coffee and alcohol. Elevate the head of your bed 6 inches. Additionally, do not eat or drink anything including water within two hours of going to bed at night or 10pm, whichever comes first. Recommend low fat, low cholesterol diet and exercise.
Continue current medications
Avoid NSAIDs (Motrin, Advil, ibuprofen, Aleve, Naproxen, etc.)

4 week follow up ER follow up; Upper GI bleed
History of Present Illness:
7/1/2025. Dr. Pearce.
Barbara presents with abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits that have been ongoing for several months. She has a history of breast cancer and is followed by an oncologist.
The patient reports experiencing pain in her lower abdomen, which has been accompanied by alternating constipation and diarrhea. The constipation is currently more frequent, though she did have a bowel movement on the day of the visit. Barbara describes the onset of her symptoms as starting a couple of months ago with gas pains. She denies any known triggers for her symptoms and has not noticed any blood in her stool. The patient mentions that she doesn't ""go like [she] should,"" indicating a change in her normal bowel habits.
Barbara has not sought medical attention specifically for these symptoms prior to this visit, though she did mention them to her nephrologist, who suggested she see a gastroenterologist. She reports having regular CT scans every 3-4 months as part of her oncology follow-up. The patient recalls being told she had diverticulitis, though it's unclear if this was confirmed by imaging. She denies significant weight loss, stating she has been trying to lose a little weight but nothing major.
The patient's symptoms appear to be impacting her daily life, prompting her to seek medical attention. She is currently taking a daily baby aspirin but denies being on any blood thinners.

9/11/2025. NP Durand.
Barbara Henk is a 76 year old female who is seen today for a follow-up visit.
Patient was hospitalized 2 months ago for hematochezia. Inpatient colonoscopy revealed bleeding AVM or dieulafoy lesion in proximal transverse colon, now s/p bipolar cautery, moderate benign-appearing stenosis in sigmoid colon, likely due to diverticular disease, and multiple nonbleeding diverticula in descending colon and sigmoid colon, and internal hemorrhoids. Prior colonoscopy done by Dr. Hays Arnold in San Antonio 9/2023 revealed severe sigmoid diverticulosis and grade 3 internal hemorrhoids.
Today she reports taking omeprazole once daily and reports mo reflux symptoms. She reports daily, sometimes every other day, bowel movements of soft stools, occasionally formed stools. She admits to inadequate dietary fiber intake but endorses adequate water intake. She reports abdominal bloating and gassiness if she skips a day without having a bowel movement. She denies hematochezia or melena, or other upper or lower GI symptoms currently.

Liver fibrosis
Assessment:
Eleanor is a vigorous 76-year-old female with history of HTN, HLP and obesity s/p remote RNY gastric bypass here today in follow up on her mixed LAEs. We reviewed her unremarkable EUS from this Spring but noted her MRE suggesting of moderate fibrosis with LIMITED fatty infiltration (although her historic fibroscans suggested fatty liver).  We will plan on repeat liver testing but consideration for liver biopsy is real here if her numbers remain high (is this AMA-negative PBC?).
Plan:
Lose weight with diet/exercise as discussed. Attempt 10% body weight loss over 6 months.*

IBS
History of Present Illness:
3/18/2024
Cecelia is a very pleasant 76-year-old female that presents to the office today to see me for evaluation of abdominal pain with constipation. Able to review that pain has been present for some time, she has significant constipation, she will go as long as 7 to 8 days without having a spontaneous bowel movement. She has been tried on several different medications without any overt improvement now utilizing Linzess 290 mcg along with stool softeners daily. This has improved the bowel movements to once every 4 to 7 days. She states that over time this causes significant left lower and left upper quadrant abdominal pressure and discomfort. She states that over 10 years ago she underwent a repair which appears to be a rectocele and cystocele repair that developed into some inadvertent misadventures that required additional surgical intervention. I do not have any of these records however she indicates that since that time she has had difficulty with urination as well as constipation. Last colonoscopy was in 2016, she does not remember any findings told to her at that time. She describes some perineal esthesia in that region as well following the surgery. Unfortunately she has a significant retinal hemorrhage which is being managed conservatively at this time by ophthalmology, there is a concern and fear that she may lose eyesight in 1 or both eyes potentially. Along with this last week she underwent a cardiac catheterization by her report for which she was noted to have 90% and 75% proximal large vessel occlusion however after intraprocedural consultation with her ophthalmologist they decided against antiplatelet therapy given the concern for advancing the retinal hemorrhage and complete blindness. She denies any melena or hematochezia, no vomiting but occasional nausea.

Cecelia is a very pleasant 76-year-old female with a BMI of 24 that returns to the office today to see me in follow-up. We were able to review that since our last visit in consultation she has undergone cardiac stenting, dealing with issues with her blood pressure. Intermittent with this she has had some nausea, bowel movements have somewhat improved with utilizing Linzess, able to review also that sitz marker study is normal. She does describe some bilateral upper left and right rib pain as well as in the midepigastric region, by report ultrasound of the abdomen showed no abnormalities, she describes this pain as somewhat constant, worse with body position and bending over as well as exertion, she continues to work with her cardiologist regarding the symptoms as well. She denies any solid or liquid dysphagia, no weight changes.

Assessment:
Cecelia Garcia is a pleasant 77-year-old female with a past medical history of constipation, GERD, CAD, HLD, HTN, migraines, sleep apnea, and fibromyalgia who presents to clinic for a follow up on abdominal pain, nausea, constipation, and GERD. Patient continues to report intermittent epigastric pain associated with uncontrolled constipation, nausea, pyrosis, and brash taste in mouth. She did not have any significant improvement on lubiprostone 8mcg BID, and had f/u with her PCP who reportedly sent in 2 additional medications including lactulose for her to add to her bowel regimen, but is unsure of the name of the new med other than lactulose. I will request records for review. She denies alarm features, weight is stable, and had recent EGD and CT that have been benign. I continue to suspect her abdominal pain and possibly even her increased GERD is related to her poorly controlled constipation. Therefore, I do recommend she trial the lactulose as prescribed by her PCP, and continue on lubiprostone 8mcg BID along with adequate hydration and exercise as tolerated. As for her GERD, I recommended she continue on pantoprazole 40 mg daily along with famotidine 40 mg nightly and adhere to aggressive antireflux measures as well as utilize ondansetron as needed. If her symptoms persist despite better control of her bowel habits and reflux, then we may consider further evaluation with include possible CT angiography. Patient expressed understanding and agreed with plan.
Plan:
My office will obtain records from referring physician, most recent OV
Adhere to lifestyle and dietary modifications for GERD diet as we discussed. This includes avoiding fatty and greasy foods, fried foods, tomato based foods, caffeine, carbonated drinks, coffee and alcohol. Elevate the head of your bed 6 inches. Additionally, do not eat or drink anything including water within two hours of going to bed at night or 10pm, whichever comes first. Recommend low fat, low cholesterol diet and exercise.
Avoid NSAIDs (Motrin, Advil, ibuprofen, Aleve, Naproxen, etc.)

Assessment:
78-year-old female presents to gastroenterology clinic with 2-month history of diarrhea. She will have anywhere from 4-6 bowel movements per day, occasionally incontinence. No overt GI bleeding, melena, hematochezia. She will have a left upper quadrant discomfort and occasional nausea. She has chronically been iron deficient given that she has a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass which was performed in 2004. Approximately 2 years ago, it sounds like she may have had a small bowel obstruction from adhesions requiring further intervention. She has a history of pancreatic cysts noted first in 2021 and followed by MRI every year. Latest MRI 8/8/2024 with a 12 mm tubular cystic lesion contiguous with the main pancreatic duct, smaller 5 mm cyst in the tail. The pancreatic cyst was 10 mm in 2023.
I would like to check stool studies to evaluate for infection, elastase to evaluate for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. She should be on a low FODMAP diet, probiotic, Lomotil. Will plan for colonoscopy with segmental biopsy. Given her left upper quadrant discomfort and nausea, we will pursue EGD to evaluate her anatomy. Will be looking for strictures, stenosis, anastomotic ulcerations. Will take biopsies of the jejunum. Will plan for an MRI, MRCP to evaluate for pancreatic cyst. She should continue to follow with hematology for routine blood work and transfusions as necessary.

Diverticulitis
History of Present Illness:
Mrs. Cynthia Nelson is a very pleasant 64 yo WF seen at the request of Dr. Chen for acute sigmoid diverticulitis.  Available records including labs/ imaging reports from an ER visit and subsequent ER visit/ observation admission reviewed:
7/23/2025 - CT Abdo/Pelvis with IV contrast - Small hiatal hernia; stomach not adequately distended for evaluation and oral contrast also not administered; left-sided diverticulosis with an inflamed diverticulum (proximal sigmoid)
7/27/2025 - CT Abdo/Pelvis without contrast - Inflammatory changes along the sigmoid have improved compared to CT done a few days ago (7/23/2025)
7/28/2025 - Labs - CBC normal; potassium 3.4, Chem 8 o/w fine; normal coags; CMP normal a few days prior along with CBC.  Other ER labs included a normal lipase, negative troponin, negative D-Dimer.  Patient also says a CT of her chest was done without concern.
Mrs. Nelson reports being seen at two urgent care clinics for a few days of upper back pain and vague abdominal pain.  None of the upper respiratory symptoms that were documented in the initial ER visit note.  CT scan when she went to the ER due to ongoing symptoms showed acute, uncomplicated proximal sigmoid diverticulitis.  Due to ongoing pain (mainly in her upper back), she returned a few days later and was admitted to the observation unit.  IV antibiotics administered along with muscle relaxants, anti-emetics, acetaminophen.  Discharged on several medications including Augmentin (x 10 days), Prednisone taper (60 mg and off within a week), and hydrocodone.
States improvement but not resolution of the abdominal pain.  Upper back pain persists and also notes fatigue.  Massage helped the upper back pain which is what she tired most recently.  Having constipation because she is unsure what can be eaten.  Also has GERD managed with an OTC PPI and that has worsened with the abdominal pain.
No prior EGD or colonoscopy.  Denies any family h/o GI malignancies.

Fatigue
Upper back pain
Assessment:
1. Acute sigmoid diverticulitis (uncomplicated)/ abnormal CT scan - Questions about diverticular disease answered.  No need for repeat labs or a 3rd CT scan.  Normal WBC on all labs reassuring.  Colonoscopy 6-8 weeks after the episode to document resolution and rule out a concurrent colon cancer.  No prior colonoscopy.
2. Change in bowel habits - Prior history of severe constipation on semaglutide which she stopped a few months ago.  The constipation improved but she is now having trouble again.  Resume fiber in her diet and start Miralax.  Fiber supplementation if Miralax causes diarrhea.  Asked to stop the hydrocodone as she has been taking it daily since discharge.
3. GERD - Mild worsening since being diagnosed with diverticulitis.  Advised to adjust when she takes the OTC PPI.
4. Fatigue/ upper back pain - Advised to discuss further with Dr. Chen.  I cannot explain either symptom with the sigmoid diverticulitis.  Referred pain from the colon to her upper back/ lower neck area does not make any sense.
5. Obesity - Long term weight loss advised.
6. Colon cancer screening - No prior colonoscopy.
7. All questions answered.
Plan:
Eat small meal portions
Do not eat 3 hours before laying down.
Miralax titration recommended

diarrhea, nausea, weight loss
History of Present Illness:
Mr. Campbell is a 65-year-old male seen for diarrhea, vomiting, nausea. He reports approximately 15 years of diarrhea. He reports that he has been dealing with IBS for approximately 15 years. He previously saw a GI specialist in Wichita Falls. He was previously on colestipol but reports that this never really helped his stooling pattern. Over the last 6 to 9 months he reports that his diarrhea has worsened, now occurring 3-7 times per week, 10-15 times daily. The frequency is similar to what was occurring earlier it is occurring more times per week. Moreover, his most bothersome symptom is nausea/vomiting which is what he refers to when he says that he is ""sick"". He states that he is feeling sick most days with significant nausea that typically occurs along with the diarrhea. He reports significant stomach burning. He has lost approximately 25 pounds over the last 9 months. He has tried multiple antacids without significant improvement. He is also tried multiple antidiarrheal medications also without improvement. He reports that over the last 2 weeks he has become diaphoretic frequently with nausea. He denies any chest pain or abdominal pain. Symptoms do not worsen with activity. He has had 2 colonoscopies and 2 EGDs in the last 10 years. No biopsies were taken on the last colonoscopy. He denies significant facial flushing along with the diarrhea.

She has only tried managing her symptoms with increased water intake but has not tried any stool softeners or laxatives. She will occasionally have bright red blood harder stools. She has been treated for hemorrhoids with sclerotherapy earlier year. She also has a slight vaginal prolapse which she went to PT many years ago and seem to get only temprorary benefit. She has continued her home exercises.  For a few months she would have left upper quadrant pain after eating it would be worse if she remains sitting after the meal. She had indigestion and heartburn. This has not occurred in the last few weeks.Of note, she was seen by a naturopath who did a GI map. She tried a GI detox that was not helpful. She then establish care with a nutritionist and she had all of her blood work. Her nutrition wanted us to look at her fecal calprotectin and zolulin levels.

Hypothyroidism
Assessment:
38 year old female with PMHx of hypothyroidism, PCOS, anxiety and depression who is being seen in consultation for IBS-C and LUQ.
Patient has a long history of constipation that has worsened in the last few months. I suspect this is multifactorial due to inadequately treated hypothyroidism, perimenopause and IBS-C. She was advised to complete a bowel cleanout and start magnesium oxide 500mg nightly and titrate up as needed. This may also help with her sleep. She was advised to use squatty potty. Can consider ARM and referral to pelvic PT in the future. May also need to consider a prescribe secretagogue.
Discussed the lack of academic research behind the GI Mapp and limitation of interpretation.  Will repeat fecal calprotectin.
Patient's intermittent rectal bleeding is due to small hemorrhoids seen on anoscopy exam today. We are treating constipation as above. Will proceed with nonurgent colonoscopy. Suflave.
Procedure was explained to patient in detail. Risks and benefits of endoscopic procedures were d/w patient in detail. Risks are but no limited to infection, bleeding, perforation, chance of a missed lesion, drug reaction or rare fatality. Patient was given an opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedure. All questions were answered. The patient agrees with the above plan. All questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction. This documentation was generated through the use of dictation and/or voice recognition software. Proofing takes place, however unintentional errors in spelling and grammar can occur.

Given ongoing symptoms despite high-dose PPI therapy, discussed consideration for EGD and after reviewing the risk, benefits and alternatives patient would like to proceed.  Constipation differential includes medication, thyroid disorder, chronic idiopathic constipation, IBS-C, slow transit constipation, pelvic floor dysfunction. Further diagnostic testing includes laboratory testing, imaging, and endoscopic evaluation. X-ray of the abdomen for further evaluation of stool burden & bowel gas pattern.  Maintain adequate hydration with at least 2L of water per day, bowel regimen as needed with MiraLAX 1-2 times daily and increase dietary fiber and OTC fiber like Benefiber 2-3 times daily but caution on potential for increased gas and/or bloating. Increase exercise as tolerated.  If workup unrevealing and ongoing symptoms despite better control of bowel habits with bowel regimen, may consider colonoscopy especially given no prior records and done >5 years ago.

Diagnoses:
Anemia, iron deficiency (c,e)
Assessment:
Assessment & Plan:
- Iron deficiency anemia
1. Iron deficiency anemia: The etiology of her significant iron deficiency anemia is unclear. Given the lack of heavy menstrual bleeding, a gastrointestinal source of blood loss or malabsorption must be ruled out. While she denies overt signs of bleeding, microscopic blood loss from conditions such as colitis, ulcers, or polyps remains a possibility. Celiac disease is also a consideration given her European ancestry and potential for malabsorption. The plan is to proceed with a comprehensive GI evaluation.
- Plan to proceed with an EGD and colonoscopy to evaluate for a source of gastrointestinal bleeding and to obtain small bowel biopsies to rule out celiac disease.
- Discussed that if the EGD and colonoscopy are unremarkable, we will then consider a video capsule endoscopy to evaluate the small bowel.
- A letter will be sent to Dr. Juvvadi to update her on the plan.
- The patient will be scheduled for the procedures by our office staff. She was given the option of having the procedure at the hospital or an ambulatory surgery center and was counseled that the surgery center is often more cost-effective.
- The bowel preparation options, including a liquid preparation and tablets, were discussed. The patient has elected to use the liquid preparation.
After Visit Summary:
- Your visit today was for iron deficiency anemia, which means your body is low on iron. The cause is not clear.
- We discussed that even though you are not seeing any bleeding, it is important to check your gastrointestinal tract (stomach and colon) for hidden sources of blood loss or for conditions that might prevent you from absorbing iron properly, like celiac disease.
- We have planned for you to have an EGD (upper endoscopy) and a colonoscopy. This involves using cameras to look at your esophagus, stomach, and colon. We will also take small tissue samples (biopsies) to test for celiac disease.
- Our office will contact you to schedule these procedures.
- You will need to take a special bowel preparation medication before the colonoscopy to clean out your colon. We discussed the options, and you chose the liquid preparation. You will receive detailed instructions for this.
- You will need to arrange for an adult to drive you to and from the procedure, as you will receive sedation.
Plan:
EGD/Colonoscopy with Anesthesia Provider/CRNA who is hereby directed and authorized to administer anesthesia - 43235/45378
Clenpiq 10 mg-3.5 gram- 12 gram/175 mL Drink 2 bottle by mouth split dose as directed
Additional Notes:
Additional Recommendations/Instructions:
1. Today we discussed your upcoming procedure:
- We discussed the importance of an excellent preparation to minimize the risk of missed polyps. **Please read the instructions for the preparation one week prior to your exam.**
- Risks include sedation related risks, perforation, immediate or delayed bleeding, infection, as well as the low risk of incomplete procedure due to retained food, poor preparation, anatomy, or a large/difficult polyp, requiring a repeat. Please call if you are having pain or bleeding after a procedure.
- If you take aspirin, you may continue taking this. Please avoid all tobacco products on the day of your procedure.
- If we remove polyps or take biopsies, you can expect to hear those results in about 1-2 weeks via either letter, phone call, or portal message. Please call 972-637-8480 if you do not hear within 3 weeks.
